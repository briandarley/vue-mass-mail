Previously, he served as the assistant vice chancellor for finance and administration and special assistant to the Chancellor for state and local relations. Prior to joining UNC-Chapel Hill in 2004, Pinkney was an associate vice president for finance for the UNC System and spent six years as a fiscal analyst with the North Carolina General Assembly.\r\n\r\nDuring his time as CFO and Senior Associate Vice Chancellor, he was instrumental in establishing a framework for consolidated administrative and business service functions for F&amp;O.

Please join me in thanking Dwayne for his many years of leadership and dedication to Carolina. We wish him the very best.\r\n\r\nNote: This memo is also being sent to University Business Managers.",

The winning research teams are pursuing solutions to two of the world’s most pressing issues: the obesity epidemic and the global clean water shortage.\r\n\r\nThe Creativity Hubs initiative was developed to support the Carolina Blueprint for Next strategic framework, and is a platform on which research teams are assembled from diverse disciplines to tackle major societal challenges.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the strengths of Carolina’s schools of medical and health sciences, its affiliated research centers and institutes, and its prowess in big data management, the Heterogeneity in Obesity Creativity Hub, led by Penny Gordon-Larsen, professor of nutrition in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health,  will take a novel approach to assess the underlying causes of obesity, tapping information that has not been traditionally studied to unlock new, targeted ways to treat the disease.\r\n\r\nBy developing an automated tool to rapidly analyze and integrate large data sets, the team will seek answers to why individuals with the same diet experience weight gain and loss differently. Their research is expected to lead to more personalized treatments that take into account the wide range of factors — from diet, to social influences, to genetics — that contribute to weight gain and loss. \r\n\r\nAddressing a need that affects over 1.8 billion people worldwide, the Sustainable Access to Clean Water Creativity Hub, led by Theo Dingemans, professor of applied physical science in the College of Arts and Sciences, will pursue development of an innovative, affordable membrane-based water purification solution that can safely remove a broad range of water contaminants.\r\n\r\nThe project team is comprised of polymer chemists, computational modelers, and engineers from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences’ Applied Physical Sciences and Mathematics departments and the Gillings School of Global Public Health. Building on existing graphene and graphene oxide membrane technologies that have shown promise as water purifiers, the team will seek to develop new filters that make water purification more energy-efficient and to lay a foundation for large-scale, affordable membrane production.\r\n\r\nThe Creativity Hubs initiative was developed by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research to foster fluid, cross-disciplinary research, to establish campus networks that nurture research innovation and risk-taking, and to promote a pervasive culture that drives discovery and curiosity. The inaugural winners of the Creativity Hubs awards were selected from proposals involving 194 UNC researchers from 35 departments in 10 schools and the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. Each team will receive up to $250,000 toward the development of their proposals. Progress will be assessed after one year and the teams could be eligible for up to an additional $250,000 in funding.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the UNC Creativity Hubs initiative and the winning teams, please visit: research.unc.edu/creativity-hubs.\r\n\r\n ",

    "content": "\r\nThe University of North Carolina System is committed to periodically reviewing its retirement programs to make sure they continue to help you meet your retirement and financial goals. Among the things considered are the range of investment options available through the plans, investment option performance and value, and the resources available to help you manage your account. \r\n\r\nAs a result of a recent review, the UNC System has decided to make the following changes to the investment lineup for both the UNC Optional Retirement Plan (ORP) and the UNC System 457(b) Plan effective May 7, 2018. \r\n\r\nPlease note these changes will not apply to the UNC System 403(b) Plan due to current federal regulations; however, the UNC System Office is contacting the Internal Revenue Service to determine if the new investment funds can be made available in the UNC System 403(b) Plan at a later date.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this email is to inform you of these changes and how you may be affected. You do not need to take any action.\r\n\r\nWHAT’S CHANGING\r\n\r\nThe UNC System will replace the 12 Vanguard Target Retirement Funds currently offered in the ORP and UNC System 457(b) Plan with Vanguard Target Retirement Trusts.\r\n\r\nThe Vanguard Target Retirement Funds currently offered in the plans are mutual funds. The new Vanguard Target Retirement Trusts are commingled trusts. Trusts operate like mutual funds but are available only to institutional investors, including you as a participant in the ORP and/or UNC System 457(b) Plan.\r\n\r\nFunds and trusts often invest in the same underlying securities and have the same objectives. Because trusts are only offered to institutions that have more money to invest, they can achieve greater efficiency and charge lower expense ratios than mutual funds. This reduces the overall cost for you to invest in them. (See the chart below for the expense ratios of the current and new investment options.)\r\n\r\nThe new Vanguard Target Retirement Trusts will be available to all ORP and UNC System 457(b) Plan participants beginning May 7, 2018. For more information about the new trusts, click here or visit the Vanguard Target Retirement Trust website at https://retirementplans.vanguard.com/ekit/pmed/trf/index.html?&amp;opw&amp;UNC&amp;.\r\n\r\nPlease note that since the Vanguard Target Retirement Trusts are only available to institutional investors, you will not be able to monitor their investment returns through a service such as Morningstar. You will need to visit your investment carrier’s website for the latest information. You may also visit the Vanguard Target Retirement Trust website and select How to Choose One. Here you will find links to the Target Retirement Trust fact sheets. The fact sheets contain the latest investment information and are updated at the end of each month.\r\n\r\nIf you are currently investing in one of the Vanguard Target Retirement Funds, the chart below shows how the current investment options will map to the new investment options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpense ratio information as of March 27, 2018.\r\n\r\nWhat You Need to Do\r\nYou do not need to do anything. When the market closes on May 7, 2018, all existing balances in the Vanguard Target Retirement Funds will be automatically transferred to the Vanguard Retirement Trusts as indicated in the chart above.

    "content": "To:       Deans, Directors and Department Chairs\r\n\r\nFrom:   Dwayne Pinkney, CFO and Senior Associate Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration; Brian T. Smith, Assistant Vice Chancellor for Finance; Ken Pittman, Executive Director, Campus Health Services\r\n\r\nRe:       Graduate Student Health Insurance Program – Enrollment for 2018-19 and Other Issues\r\n\r\nIn August 2009, the UNC Board of Governors approved the implementation of a “hard waiver” student health insurance plan on all sixteen 4-year campuses beginning in fall 2010. The term “hard waiver” means any graduate or undergraduate student meeting three specific criteria (enrolled in a minimum of 6 credit hours if an undergraduate or 1 credit hour if a graduate student, degree-seeking, and eligible to pay the student health fee) is required to show evidence of an existing “creditable coverage” health insurance policy or purchase a creditable insurance policy OR enroll in the UNC system-wide plan.\r\n\r\nGraduate students enrolled in the Graduate Student Health Insurance Program (GSHIP), frequently referred to as the RA/TA Health Insurance Plan, must submit an online waiver using their GSHIP insurance at  www.bcbsnc.com/unc or they will be charged $1,311.50 each semester on their University account for the system wide Student Blue insurance plan available to all undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe UNC Chapel Hill GSHIP plan is a separate insurance plan from the system wide Student Blue insurance plan. Graduate students functioning as Research Assistants (RA), Teaching Assistants (TA), Fellows, or Trainees should continue to be enrolled in the GSHIP plan each semester through their academic program. RA/TA’s should not enroll themselves in the system wide Student Blue insurance plan available to all undergraduates and graduate students.\r\n\r\nDue to ongoing state and federal regulatory changes in health care and the insurance marketplace, UNC General Administration has been reviewing all University sponsored health plans system-wide.  Effective with the 2014-2015 plan year, the RA/TA Plan was no longer offered as an employer provided plan and enrollees do not have access to COBRA upon discontinuation of the plan.\r\n\r\nOther GSHIP plan benefits remain the same and require fewer out of pocket expenses than the system wide Student Blue insurance plan. The system wide Student Blue insurance plan cannot be substituted for the GSHIP plan.\r\n\r\nThe insurance program for graduate students is separate from insurance programs for Clinical Fellows, Postdoctoral Trainees, and Postdoctoral Research Associates. The purpose of this memorandum is to provide information regarding the 2018-19 enrollment process for the Graduate Student Health Insurance Program as well as other pertinent information. The 2018-19 policy year is from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019.\r\n\r\nFor the 2018-19 policy year the minimum prescribed compensation amount for services that a student must receive is $5,700.00. The premium cost per student for annual coverage during the current policy year under the program, provided through Blue Cross Blue Shield of NC, is $3994.92 ($332.91 per month). The Campus Health Fee is $200.08 per semester ($400.15 per academic year) for fiscal year 2018-19.\r\n\r\nPlease note the following:\r\n\r\nFor the 2018-19 policy year BCBS will not automatically waive graduate students that are enrolled in the GSHIP insurance. Students must complete an online waiver or be charged for the system wide Student Blue insurance plan.  The fall waiver deadline is September 10, 2018 and the spring waiver deadline is January 31, 2019.\r\n\r\nTo ensure students receive their GSHIP BCBS policy ID card prior to August 1st the department must enroll their RA/TA’s into GSHIP with ample time to receive their cards.  Enrollment must be completed even for those students currently on the GSHIP plan. If enrollments are not received by BCBSNC prior to August 15, 2018, students will receive a HIPAA certificate from BCBSNC stating coverage terminated July 31, 2018.  If they feel they have received the letter in error, they will be directed to their academic program/department for any questions concerning receipt of this letter.\r\n\r\nEffective August 1, 2015 retroactive enrollments or terminations exceeding 60 days will no longer be allowed for administrative errors.  Exceptions for extenuating circumstances (delays due to death, hospitalization, etc.) will only be considered.\r\n\r\nThe following policy, procedures, forms and manual (see links below) provide detailed information about the Graduate Student Health Insurance Plan. Please review all documents.\r\n\r\nPolicy 1112 – Graduate Student Health Insurance Program (GSHIP) - Eligibility Criteria and Other Provisions of the Health Insurance Plan (http://financepolicy.unc.edu/1112 )\r\nProcedure 1112.1 – Verifying Student Eligibility for GSHIP (http://financepolicy.unc.edu/1112_1 )\r\nForm - 1112.1.1f – Graduate Student Health Insurance Program Verification of Student Eligibility (https://financepolicy.unc.edu/1112_1_1f )\r\nProcedure 1112.2 – Enrolling in the Graduate Student Health Insurance Program (GSHIP) (http://financepolicy.unc.edu/1112_2 )\r\nProcedure 1112.3 – Paying Graduate Students (http://financepolicy.unc.edu/1112_3)\r\nProcedure 1112.4 – Paying GSHIP Insurance Premium (http://financepolicy.unc.edu/1112_4 )\r\n\r\nThe information in this memorandum is the result of extensive discussions among academic and administrative departments concerning appropriate procedures and practices for the Graduate Student Health Insurance Program. Your additional comments regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of the procedures and practices are most welcome as efforts to improve the program administration.\r\n\r\nPlease notify the following individuals regarding your questions or comments.

    "content": "Have you ever wondered why some babies are bold while others are cautious?\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought the answer might be in the human gut?\r\n\r\nGUT MICROBIOTA AND ANXIETY is a research study at UNC Chapel Hill exploring how organisms living in the human gut affect brain development and babies’ responses to new situations. We are currently recruiting pregnant women and new mothers.\r\nDetails are below. Please share this message with friends and family. \r\n\r\nParticipants receive: \r\n- $200 per visit (potential total of $400) \r\n- Reimbursement for mileage and parking \r\n\r\nWho can participate in this study? To be in this study, your child must be exclusively breastfed (no formula, gripe water, or sugar water) until the first study visit. Babies cannot be in the study if they receive formula or antibiotics before the first study visit.\r\n\r\nWhat does this study involve? When your child is 2 weeks old he/she will receive a MRI scan of the brain. We will also collect a small blood sample via heel prick and several samples of saliva (spit). When your child is 1 year old, we will observe how he/she responds to new people and toys. He/she will also receive a MRI scan at this visit. We will collect a small blood sample via heel prick and spit samples as before. We will also ask you to collect fecal (stool) samples from your child prior to both visits.\r\n\r\nWhy participate in this study? Research is designed to benefit society by gaining new knowledge. By participating you and your child may help us better understand and prevent psychiatric problems in future generations. The benefits to your child from being in this study may be the opportunity to have a thorough evaluation of his or her brain and early behavior.\r\n\r\nAre there any risks? There is no evidence that MRI scans have any harmful effects. MRIs do not use x-rays or radiation. Children are scanned during natural sleep. Heel pricks will be done by trained personnel with supplies designed to minimize discomfort.\r\nRemember:  this is a voluntary study, no medicine or sedation is involved, you will be compensated, and all information gathered is confidential.\r\n\r\nHow do I learn more about joining this study?  Call Jennifer Prater, study coordinator, at (919) 843-5902 or (866) 849-0541 (Toll Free), or send an email to jennifer_prater@med.unc.edu with your name, phone number and times that you can be reached. This is a confidential study: we will not share your email address with anyone outside of the study. \r\n\r\nThis research study is funded by the National Institute of Health.\r\n\r\nThe Early Brain Development Study and this message have received approval on May 1st, 2017 from the UNC Biomedical IRB, Study # 14-0932",

We know that sleep is a critical aspect of health and brain development. However, little has been done to document patterns of sleep in young children or examine how brain activity during sleep may differ in children with delays and children with autism. \r\n\r\n\r\n~You may be eligible if:\r\n· Your family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months with language delays (i.e., no words at 18 months, limited vocalizations at 12 months)\r\n. Your family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months with delays in social communication or play\r\n. Your family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months with an autism spectrum disorder.\r\n · Your family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months who has an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder.\r\n\r\n~We schedule the two visits at your convenience and you will be with your child at all times. Each visit will take about 2- 2 ½ hours. The types of activities involved: \r\n. A visit to your home at your convenience: Infant developmental assessments \r\n. A visit to the nap room: Non-invasive recording (brain rhythms) during a midday nap. Your child will be playing with a variety of toys and taking a nap. This location offers free parking.\r\n\r\nWe will compensate you $75 for your time. For more information, or to see if your child is eligible, please call Jessica Page at 919-445-0227 or email jessica.page@unc.edu or EDS@med.unc.edu. You can find out more on our website at http://www.frohlichlab.org/.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your participation!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frohlich Lab\r\n\r\n\r\nThis study was approved by the UNC biomedical IRB on 1/16/18 (IRB # 15-1829)",

We are currently recruiting pregnant women and new mothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails are below. Please share this message with friends and family. \r\n\r\nParticipants receive: \r\n- $200 per visit (potential total of $400) \r\n- Reimbursement for mileage and parking \r\n\r\nWho can participate in this study? To be in this study, your child must be exclusively breastfed until the first study visit. Babies cannot be in the study if they receive formula, sugar water, gripe water, or antibiotics before the first study visit.\r\n\r\nWhat does this study involve? When your child is 2 weeks old he/she will receive a MRI scan of the brain. We will also collect a small blood sample via heel prick and several samples of saliva (spit). When your child is 1 year old, we will observe how he/she responds to new people and toys. He/she will also receive a MRI scan at this visit. We will collect a small blood sample via heel prick and spit samples as before. We will also ask you to collect fecal (stool) samples from your child prior to both visits.\r\n\r\nWhy participate in this study? Research is designed to benefit society by gaining new knowledge. By participating you and your child may help us better understand and prevent psychiatric problems in future generations. The benefits to your child from being in this study may be the opportunity to have a thorough evaluation of his or her brain and early behavior.\r\n\r\nAre there any risks? There is no evidence that MRI scans have any harmful effects. MRIs do not use x-rays or radiation. Children are scanned during natural sleep.

It is NOT required, and open to anyone who is interested in taking it, and their parents. (No obligation to take the class if they come to the informational session).\r\n\r\nUNC now offers a mindful self-compassion class for adolescents, ages 14-18. Mindful Self-Compassion brings together the benefits of mindfulness and self-compassion:  Mindfulness teaches us to be present with difficult emotions, and self-compassion helps us to respond to these emotions with greater kindness and self-care.\r\n\r\nThrough developmentally appropriate activities and meditations, teens learn specific tools, which help them, navigate the emotional difficulties of this life stage with greater ease.  A preliminary research study on this program has demonstrated significant decreases in depression, anxiety, perceived stress and negative mood from before to after taking this course.\r\n\r\nClass Dates: Thursdays, April 26 through June 14, 2018\r\n\r\nInstructors: Kate Murphy and Laura Prochnow Phillips\r\n\r\nTime: 5:00-6:45PM\r\n\r\nLocation:UNC Center for Rehabilitation Care, 1807 Fordham Blvd., Chapel Hill NC 27514\r\n\r\nTo Register, click here!\r\n\r\nFor more information, please call 919-966-8586 or email mindfulness@med.unc.edu\r\n\r\nPlease visit our website for additional course information and like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Tan has served as chief of research strategy for the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR) since July of 2016.   \r\n\r\nAs associate vice chancellor for research, she promotes interdisciplinary integration, cultivating growth of the University’s global research reputation. Her responsibilities include working closely with leadership in University schools and the College, as well as pan-campus centers and institutes to design, facilitate collaboration and execute strategic, multidisciplinary initiatives such as the OVCR’s Creativity Hubs program. She also facilitates innovation and entrepreneurship by connecting the OVCR with leadership across UNC, and by promoting research partnerships with external public and private organizations.\r\n\r\nPrior to working with the OVCR, Tan served as director of industry alliances within the School of Medicine and program manager for the Carolina Center for Genome Sciences and the Department of Genetics.  In these roles she conducted capacity building activities to attract extramural funding as well as, built and developed partnerships and alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.  Her scientific background is in immunology, and she has made important scientific contributions to vaccine development, the understanding of how T cells populate the immune system, and how T cells maintain memory to respond to subsequent infections.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in welcoming and supporting Joyce in her new role.",

We are planning a CAREER workshop to be held April 23, 3:00pm-4:30pm. \r\n\r\nThe proposed agenda includes an overview of the CAREER program including tips and resources by Peter Mucha, a past NSF CAREER winner and Bowman and Gordon Gray Professor in the Department of Mathematics. Dr. Mucha led NSF CAREER mentoring efforts on campus the year UNC received 8 CAREER awards! Following Dr. Mucha, each CAREER winner attending will briefly share from their experience with the CAREER program. For the last portion of the workshop, we will offer time to break into small group sessions, where mentors will work in more detail with the applicants to answer their questions about the process or their research ideas. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested, please email me, Denise Lindley at lindleyd@email.unc.edu to get more information. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDenise Lindley\r\nOffice of Research Development",

    "content": "Dear University Employee,\r\n\r\nBeginning with the February 16, 2018, biweekly paycheck, all biweekly and monthly paychecks subject to federal tax withholdings reflect the 2018 federal tax withholding rates issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As we shared with you in a February communication, the federal tax rate changes are a part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017.\r\n\r\nThe law increased the standard deduction, removed personal exemptions, increased the child tax credit, limited or discontinued certain deductions and changed the tax rates and brackets.  Due to these changes along with others, the IRS is recommending that all employees perform a paycheck checkup by using the Withholding Calculator on www.irs.gov/withholding. This website contains more information concerning the Withholding Calculator and Federal Tax Withholding Tables.\r\n\r\nThe Withholding Calculator can help employees estimate their 2018 annual income tax liability, and based on its recommendations, can help prevent too little or too much income tax from being withheld.  The withholding calculator compares the annual income tax estimate to the employee’s current income tax withholding and can help them decide if they need to change their withholding.  Employees using the calculator will find it helpful to have their completed 2017 tax return accessible and most recent paystub.  Employees are also encouraged to contact their tax professional should they have questions on how to accurately complete the information contained on the withholding calculator.\r\n\r\nEmployees can use the results from the Withholding Calculator to determine if they should complete a new Form W-4, Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate. Form W-4 can be submitted electronically via the ConnectCarolina Self-Service menu.\r\n\r\nIf you have problems accessing the ConnectCarolina Self-Service items, please contact the Help Desk. If after working with the Help Desk you are unable to update your W-4 please contact Payroll Services at payroll@unc.edu for assistance.\r\n\r\nWalter Miller\r\nDirector of Payroll Services",

The group will meet twice per week and each class will last one hour and 15 minutes. Free parking is provided and the studio is on the bus route.\r\n\r\nAs part of the research study, participants will also come to the UNC campus on four occasions to complete assessments (free parking provided). The first two visits will be prior to beginning the Tai Chi class, and the final two visits will be after the 8-week Tai Chi period. The assessments will involve filling out questionnaires, telling us about your medical health, performing a variety of cognitive tasks, as well as collecting measurements of brain activity using EEG.\r\n\r\nTake the questionnaire! We'll let you know if you're eligible and provide further information on how to get started.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit taichistudy.web.unc.edu or contact Dr. Aaron Piepmeier at atpiepme@med.unc.edu.

It’s the first page that you see before logging into ConnectCarolina.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Changes\r\n\r\nWe‘ve simplified the page layout and made it is easier to navigate. The links work the same as they do now. Only the look is different.\r\nLooking for the InfoPorte link? It’s in ConnectCarolina under Enterprise Reporting on the left.\r\nFor Students\r\n\r\nThe first column on the updated webpage is for students and their proxy users. Like today, students will click the big green button to get to the ConnectCarolina Student Center, and once in ConnectCarolina, everything will work the same as it does now. \r\n\r\nParents or others can pay bills or see student info by clicking the blue buttons in the lower left.  (As always, students first need to give them access.)\r\n\r\nClick the first link under the green button, Useful Links for Students to go to a friendlier version of the page students currently use.\r\n\r\nFor Faculty, Staff, and Affiliates\r\n\r\nImportant links for Faculty, Staff and Affiliates are in the middle column.  We’ve added a few extra links to online and classroom training, online documentation and the ConnectCarolina User Info website.\r\n\r\nThe third column includes Useful Links, Security Information and the Announcements section. \r\n\r\nQuestions?\r\n\r\nSend an email to cc_communications@unc.edu if you have questions or concerns. There is no associated outage and it will not impact registration or other work in ConnectCarolina.",

This bilingual event serves to celebrate the work and dedication that students have devoted to the Latinx community. Students do not have to identify as Latinx to participate.\r\n\r\nProfessor Nilda Peragallo Montana, Dean of the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Nursing, will deliver the keynote.

There are a number of sources of university forms and sources of support; please exhaust these other options before applying for the Professional Development Grant.\r\n\r\nGrants are open this round until June 30, 2018.\r\n\r\nPlease apply!\r\n\r\nApplication criteria and other relevant information are available here.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Andrews Distinguished Professor of Pediatrics in the School of Medicine, and has held a variety of other senior administrative positions at Carolina.  \r\n\r\nThe Institute for the Environment is charged with supporting the University’s multi-disciplinary community of environmental researchers, enhancing collaboration, sharing knowledge, and developing solutions to critical environmental problems facing North Carolina and the world.  It works with partners across the University and externally to coordinate and deliver 21st century programs that provide students with experience and skills they can use to thrive in a growing global economy.  It takes environmental discoveries and knowledge and puts them into practice by engaging and serving communities here in North Carolina and around the globe.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in welcoming Mike Piehler to his new role at the Institute for the Environment and thanking Dave Peden for his capable stewardship as IE’s interim director. \r\n\r\n ",

    "content": "On behalf of Jessica Brinker, Interim Director, William &amp; Ida Friday Center for Continuing Education:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am pleased to share this year’s continuing education report which shows programs supporting Carolina’s mission of public service and instruction. In the 2016-2017 reporting year, UNC-Chapel Hill departments and outreach units engaged a record 448,736 individuals in North Carolina and around the world in continuing education activities. The 2016–17 Continuing Education Programs and Registrations report can be seen at:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhttps://fridaycenter.unc.edu/files/2018/03/2016-2017-Continuing-Education-Programs-and-Registrations-Final-Report.pdf\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor the one-year period ending June 30, 2017, 28 units of the University reported information on 3,753 noncredit continuing education courses of various kinds, in which 448,736 individuals enrolled. The previous year’s figures were 3,496 courses and 395,500 registrants.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 2016-17, courses were offered in 59 counties in North Carolina, 26 states other than our own (including the District of Columbia), and 51 foreign countries.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCourses were conducted in a variety of formats. Online course offerings continued to be in demand. These courses comprised 51 percent of the registrant total, followed by classroom courses at 24 percent of the registrant total.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe breadth of continuing education programming and the diverse clientele it serves are illustrated by the programming highlights shown in the last part of the report, which some units chose to provide along with their data.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is clear from this report that we are helping individuals at the local, state, and international level achieve personal and professional educational goals through the continuing education opportunities offered by the University. Through the annual compilation of this report, the Friday Center is proud to play a role in supporting the University’s commitment to lifelong learning and outreach.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please don’t hesitate to contact me at Jessica_Brinker@unc.edu.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJessica Brinker\r\n\r\nInterim Director, William &amp; Ida Friday Center for Continuing Education\r\n\r\nDirector of Credit Programs\r\n\r\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\r\n\r\n100 Friday Center Drive, Campus Box 1020\r\n\r\nChapel Hill, NC 27599\r\n\r\nT: 919-962-2646\r\n\r\nfridaycenter.unc.edu\r\n\r\nmore.unc.edu\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

As part of this merger of functions, several staff moves will take place: Beverly Braxton and Hua Shen will move to this unit from Purchasing Services and will continue to support P-Card operations.\r\n\r\nThe new eProcurement and Materials Management unit will be managed by Ammar Yameen, and will focus on logistics and eProcurement functions.  Logistics will now include the following:  surplus store, central receiving, mini storeroom and the dental stockroom.  Al Jeter, longtime manager of surplus store operations, has been promoted and will lead all logistics operations, including central receiving, surplus property and the general storeroom, with the exception of the dental stockroom, which will continue to be led by Kris Tilley. \r\n\r\nSystems and Operations will be renamed as Accounts Payable and Travel Services and will continue to be led by Janet Rupert.\r\n\r\nPurchasing Services will remain under the leadership of Bernard Law.\r\n\r\nDuring the next several weeks, we will update our website and staff listings to reflect these changes.  During this transition period, if you have any questions or concerns about the reorganization, please contact Travis Henderson at travishenderson@unc.edu.\r\n\r\n Note:  This memo was sent to Major Organizational Unit (MOU) Financial Leads, University Business Managers and the Research Administrative Support Group (RASG) Listserv.\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

The announcements of the prizes will be made at the first Faculty Council meeting of the fall term of 2018.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to help recognize and reward the work of Carolina’s most promising young faculty.",

    "content": "Hello, my name is Eric Trexler.  I am a doctoral student in the Department of Exercise and Sport Science, and I am currently recruiting participants for a research study, entitled “Performance effects of citrulline malate and beetroot juice supplementation.”\r\n\r\nWe are looking for healthy, recreationally active men between the ages of 18-35. To qualify for this study, you must be a non-smoker who typically exercises at least two hours per week. In addition, you must not be using supplements or prescription drugs that may influence performance. The purpose of this study is to determine if acute supplementation with the commercially available dietary supplements citrulline malate and/or beetroot juice influence leg strength or muscular endurance.\r\n\r\nAs a participant, you will be required to sign an informed consent document stating you understand all of the procedures and rights as a research subject, and to fill out questionnaires regarding your health, diet, and physical activity history. The study includes 4 lab visits over the course of 12-30 days.\r\n\r\nYour first visit will involve filling out some paperwork and becoming familiarized to the leg extension strength test. At the final three visits, you will consume either citrulline malate, beetroot juice, or a placebo, in random order. Strength testing will be repeated at each visit, two hours after supplement ingestion, to assess leg strength and endurance. During testing, we will noninvasively measure blood flow, muscle size, and oxygen consumption. We will also draw a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm before and after the exercise. All testing will take place in the Neuromuscular Research Laboratory and Applied Physiology Laboratory, which are both located in Fetzer Hall.\r\n\r\nIf you complete the study, you will receive up to $75 in compensation, along with free strength testing. If you are interested or have questions, please contact Eric Trexler by phone or email.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEric Trexler\r\n\r\ntrexlere@live.unc.edu\r\n\r\n919-962-2163\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis study (IRB #17-2666) was approved by the UNC Biomedical IRB on 3/8/2018",

In keeping with this goal, the University will implement a central pool for the payout of terminal leave effective July 1, 2018. This central terminal leave payout pool will fund any unused vacation and bonus leave that is eligible for payout upon an employee’s separation from the University. Composite benefits and severance pay are already paid from a separate central pool and will continue to operate with no changes.\r\n\r\n The central terminal leave payout pool will be funded by an assessment of 1.2% of all SHRA and EHRA Non-Faculty employees’ salary funding sources, for each pay period, using a new account code (516130). This rate was determined by reviewing past leave payouts over the past five fiscal years. The total payouts from this central pool will be reviewed annually and the rate will be increased or decreased to adjust for higher or lower than expected payouts.\r\n\r\nThe existing central composite benefits and severance pay rates will remain unchanged for fiscal year 2018-19 and will also continue to be reviewed annually. A summary of the applicable rates is listed below.\r\n\r\nAny terminal leave payouts that are due to employees that separate from the University July 1, 2018 or later will be paid from the central pool and departments will no longer be responsible for those charges. Although this new Terminal Leave Payout assessment may have an impact on how schools and departments plan and budget, we anticipate that the change will provide for greater financial predictability as departments will pay for terminal leave payouts incrementally in advance rather than at the time of employee separation which may not always be anticipated.\r\n\r\nComposite Benefits Fund\r\n\r\nExpense Account Code: 516120\r\nSalary Base: EHRA and SHRA Salaries paid from Non-State Funds\r\nRate: 0.50% (Unchanged from prior FY)\r\n\r\nSeverance Pay Pool\r\n\r\nExpense Account Code: 512510\r\nSalary Base: SHRA Salaries paid from Non-State Funds\r\nRate: 1.00% (Unchanged from prior FY)\r\n\r\nTerminal Leave Payout Pool\r\n\r\nExpense Account Code: 516130\r\nSalary Base: EHRA Non-Faculty and SHRA paid from All Funds\r\nRate: 1.20% (New)",

This bilingual event serves to celebrate the work and dedication that students have devoted to the Latinx community. Students do not have to identify as Latinx to participate.\r\n\r\nProfessor Nilda Peragallo Montana, Dean of the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Nursing, will deliver the keynote. Following our tradition, all participating students will receive a unique Éxitos Latinx stole as a small token of appreciation for their commitment.\r\n\r\nFamilies and friends will have the opportunity to connect with the people who have guided the graduating students on their Carolina journey, take pictures with Rameses, and enjoy Latinx-inspired cuisine. We will also livestream the event on Facebook.\r\n\r\nRSVP required. Please register here.\r\n\r\nPlease contact Josmell Perez at josmell@unc.edu if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nThe Carolina Latinx Collaborative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ",

    "content": "\r\nDear Carolina Community:\r\n\r\nI am writing to share with you that Phyllis Petree, chief audit officer, will retire at the end of September after 23 years of faithful service to Carolina. I appreciate Phyllis’ countless contributions that have enhanced and improved University operations. Phyllis is a trusted adviser to me, our senior administrators and the Board of Trustees. She will conclude her devoted tenure having served five chancellors and dozens of other University leaders.\r\n\r\nA 1978 alumna, Phyllis returned to Carolina in 1995 as the director of internal audit, and has transformed the audit function to meet the growing needs of the campus community and to ensure we remain accountable to the taxpayers of North Carolina. Under Phyllis’ leadership, the internal audit office has provided expansive consulting and advisory services across the University. I know all campus leaders will join me in thanking Phyllis for the depth and breadth of her counsel, careful analysis and attention to detail in every matter.\r\n\r\nOver the past two decades, Phyllis has worked diligently to ensure that the University’s processes and procedures are best in class. Phyllis streamlined our audit processes and developed the first internal audit charter; internal audit manual; and finance, infrastructure and audit committee charter. She implemented risk-based internal audit schedules and projects. She developed a strategic plan and key performance indicators for the internal audit office. She also commissioned the first external quality assessment review to evaluate the internal audit office’s conformity with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing.\r\n\r\nPhyllis has always approached her work with the utmost integrity, and her keen understanding of campus operations and steady guidance will be missed. Vice Chancellor for Finance and Operations Jonathan Pruitt will chair the search committee for the next chief audit officer, and I am grateful that Phyllis will remain in the position until her successor is hired.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in thanking Phyllis for her steadfast leadership and commitment to Carolina and wishing her well in retirement.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarol L. Folt\r\nChancellor\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "\r\nDear Faculty and Staff:\r\n\r\nWe want to encourage high-performing, high-potential managers to apply for the annual University Leadership Education and Development (ULEAD) program. ULEAD gives participants the tools and skills they need to meet the challenges of the changing higher education landscape and take the next step in their careers. The program emphasizes strategic thinking, innovation, communication, and teamwork. This is an excellent opportunity to participate in a proven professional development program specific to higher education.\r\n\r\nPre-program elements of ULEAD begin in late spring, and the program runs through the fall semester. The curriculum includes a series of classes, a 360 multi-rater assessment, peer coaching, and team projects designed to contribute in real and innovative ways to improving university effectiveness. Participants receive the benefit of learning from the world-renowned faculty of the Kenan-Flagler Business School, as well as other highly regarded professionals.\r\n\r\nTo provide the maximum opportunity for interaction and networking, ULEAD selects 19 representatives from UNC-Chapel Hill, four from NC Central University, and one from the UNC System Office. Participants must be high-performing, highly motivated managers who are directly responsible for at least one supervisor or for a program of significant size and complexity. Applicants are nominated by their managers and must receive approval from their Dean, Vice Chancellor, or designee.\r\n\r\nApplications will be accepted for ULEAD through April 5. The program is extremely competitive, so we encourage applicants to ensure their application materials best reflect their development goals and achievements.\r\n\r\nFor the online application and full program schedule, as well as more information on ULEAD, visit https://hr.unc.edu/ulead/. This program is sponsored by the Office of Human Resources in the Division of Workforce Strategy, Equity and Engagement.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or wish to find out more about ULEAD, please contact William Frey in the Office of Human Resources at 962-9685 or will_frey@unc.edu.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFelicia A.

Immerse yourself in the music of North Carolina, past and present, with Leaving Eden, a new play by Mike Wiley with music by Laurelyn Dossett.\r\n\r\nBe swept along to the fictional town of Marah, North Carolina, where black families worked in its cotton mills during 1930s and the Latino immigrants work in its processing plants today. Echoes of love, violence, and racial tension rumble in word and music born from being needed but not wanted and the quest for the restless to make a home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaywright Mike Wiley was just named a Distinguished Alumnus of UNC-Chapel Hill for his compelling works of documentary theatre, sharing dynamic portrayals of pivotal moments in African-American history. Meanwhile, Laurelyn Dossett’s multifaceted music career has seen her tour with the North Carolina Symphony and collaborate with Grammy Award-winning Rhiannon Giddens and the Carolina Chocolate Drops.\r\n\r\nLeaving Eden is the rightful descendant of the Carolina Playmakers’ storied tradition of oral history-style folk plays, originated by UNC’s “Proff” Koch in 1918. It is also PlayMakers’ first full commission in its 40+ years as a professional theatre company.\r\n\r\nLeaving Eden runs April 4 through 22. To save even more, make a point to see the show while it’s still in previews, April 4–6, when tickets are already up to 20% less.\r\n\r\nNEW THIS SEASON: Login with your ONYEN and receive the faculty/staff discount online!

    "content": "SUBJECT:  MUSC 364 Summer Jazz Workshop | Summer School Course Satisfying the Experiential Education Requirement (June 18-22, 2018)\r\n\r\nUNC Summer School and the Department of Music MUSC 364 will offer the UNC Summer Jazz Workshop (https://music.UNC.edu/SummerJazzWorkshop) Monday-Friday June 18-22, 2018. The course applies to Summer School Session II, earning 3.0 credit hours, and it satisfies the \"Experiential Education\" requirement at UNC.  There are two ways to attend and receive college credit:\r\n\r\n1. As a student in MUSC 364 studying music related journalism, jazz history, and learning basic music skills. These students learn journalism using social media, write blogs about the evening concerts, study jazz history, and learn rudimentary music skills. They are not required to perform in a combo during the workshop.\r\n\r\n2. As a performer in MUSC 364 studying jazz theory, improvisation, playing in a combo, participating in group lessons and jam sessions, and performing in the final Friday afternoon Student Combo Concert.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE WORKSHOP: The UNC Summer Jazz Workshop (https://music.UNC.edu/SummerJazzWorkshop) is a partnership between UNC Summer School and the Department of Music that began in 2011 and has drawn students from across the country since then. This unique five-day program caters to students of a variety of ages -- high school students, college students, and adults who want to study and be immersed in a high-paced jazz program which provides instruction in jazz theory, improvisation, small group playing, and group lessons. Rising high school seniors, college students, and adults have the option to enroll in MUSC 364 to earn 3.0 hours of college credit, while those in the Community section of the workshop participate in a separate track of morning classes. In the afternoon, those in the MUSC 364 Performance and the Community classes join together in the jazz combos, lessons, and evening concerts. Each evening, Monday through Thursday, the faculty and guest artists give concerts, and students attend the performances. On Friday evening, the student combos will perform. All concerts are free and open to the public. Refreshments are served each afternoon between classes. The students receive UNC SJW T-shirts and water bottles.\r\n\r\nCONCERT SCHEDULE: This year the featured guests will be The Dominican Jazz Project (http://dominicanjazzproject.com/about), a Latin jazz group featuring artists from the Dominican Republic.

This reorganization will allow us to align related roles within primary reporting units while allowing for operational efficiencies. We will continue to maintain our current levels of service and support to the University campus in these areas.\r\n\r\nEngineering and Construction\r\nThe Engineering Services and Construction Services and Management departments will be merged into one unit. Greg Driver, currently executive director of Engineering Services and University Engineer, will oversee this consolidated group of Facilities functions in his new position of executive director of Engineering and Construction. This department will provide the following services: Facilities Engineering, Energy Management, Construction Management and Construction Services.\r\n\r\nFacilities Planning and Design\r\nEngineering Information Services will be managed as a division of the Facilities Planning and Design department under the leadership of Executive Director and Assistant University Architect Evan Yassky. Facilities Planning and Design will now provide the following services: Project Planning and Management, Design Services, Interior Design and Space Planning, and Engineering Information Services.\r\n\r\nThe Facilities Services website will be updated to reflect this new departmental structure in the coming week. If you have any questions or concerns about these organizational changes, please contact Greg Driver at greg.driver@fac.unc.edu or Evan Yassky at evan.yassky@facilities.unc.edu.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ",

    "content": "Subject: Early Development and Sleep Research Study\nHello, The Frohlich Lab, a leader in brain network dynamics at UNC, has an exciting research study that your infant/toddler between the ages of 12-30 months can participate in with just 2 short sessions.\n In this research study, we are examining sleep characteristics in infants/toddlers that may have:\n-Language delays (i.e., no words at 18 months, limited vocalizations at 12 months)\n-Delays in social communication or play                   \n-Autism or who are at-risk for autism (have a sibling with autism). \nChildren develop and change rapidly during infancy and toddlerhood. We know that sleep is a critical aspect of health and brain development. However, little has been done to document patterns of sleep in young children or examine how brain activity during sleep may differ in children with delays and children with autism.\n~You may be eligible if:\nYour family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months with language delays (i.e., no words at 18 months, limited vocalizations at 12 months)\n. Your family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months with delays in social communication or play\n.  Your family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months with an autism spectrum disorder.\nYour family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months who has an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder.\n \n~We schedule the two visits at your convenience and you will be with your child at all times. Each visit will take about 2- 2 ½ hours. The types of activities involved:\n. A visit to your home at your convenience: Infant developmental assessments\n. A visit to the nap room: Non-invasive recording (brain rhythms) during a midday nap. Your child will be playing with a variety of toys and taking a nap. This location offers free parking. We will compensate you $75 for your time. For more information, or to see if your child is eligible, please call Jessica Page at 919-445-0227 or email jessica.page@unc.edu or EDS@med.unc.edu.  You can find out more on our website at http://www.frohlichlab.org/. We look forward to your participation! The Frohlich Lab                         This study was approved by the UNC biomedical IRB on 1/17/18 (IRB # 15-1829)",

Audience participation will be strongly encouraged.\r\n\r\n“Navigating Unlawful Harassment and Uncomfortable Situations in the Workplace” will be presented by Brandon Washington, director of the Equal Opportunity and Compliance Office, and Adrienne Allison, director of Title IX Compliance.\r\n\r\nAll faculty, staff and students are encouraged to participate in this critical discussion. Details are provided in the linked flyer.\r\n\r\nUpcoming 2018 Carolina Conversations discussion topics will include:\r\n\r\nApril: “What Does It Mean to be a Public University?”\r\n\r\nTBD: “Talking About UNC History”\r\n\r\nDates for these monthly sessions will be announced soon.

    "content": "Hello, my name is Brett Pexa and I am a doctoral student in the Human Movement Science Curriculum at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The research team I am working with consists of Dr. Eric Ryan, Dr. Joe Myers, Dr. Tony Hackney, and Dr. David Berkoff. We are reaching out to you in hopes that you can participate in a research study entitled “Non-invasive Assessment of Overuse Injury Mechanisms in the Adolescent Athlete.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are looking for healthy male baseball players between the ages of 13 – 18. To qualify for this study, pitcher must be or have been your primary or secondary position. You must not be injured, or have pain or discomfort that has limited your baseball participation for the last 3 months. You can have no previous shoulder or elbow surgery in the past year, and must be able to pitch the age recommended amount of pitches based on USA Baseball’s Pitch Smart guidelines. The purpose of this research study is to determine if ultrasound imaging of the infraspinatus, a shoulder muscle, can show how muscles recover following a bout of baseball pitching.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs a participant, you will be required to sign an informed consent document stating you understand all of the procedures and rights as a research subject, and to fill out questionnaires regarding your baseball participation, injuries, and training. The study includes 4 testing visits over the course of 6 days. Your first visit will involve filling out the paperwork and performing the baseline assessment which will consist of a finger stick blood draw, shoulder range of motion and strength measures, and an ultrasound image of your infraspinatus, a muscle critical to baseball pitching. These images are taken with an ultrasound machine. Diagnostic ultrasound creates an image using sound waves, so no radiation or damaging imaging will be used with this study.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFollowing the baseline testing, you will immediately pitch an age prescribed amount of pitches based on USA Baseball’s Pitch Smart guidelines. Once the pitch count is reached, the same testing procedures will be performed again.  You will be asked to return on day 1, day 3, and day 5 following your bout of pitching, where the exact same assessments will be performed.   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nParticipants can receive up to $100 dollars in compensation. If you are interested or have questions, please contact Brett Pexa by phone or email.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBrett Pexa\r\n\r\n919-843-2014\r\n\r\npexa@live.unc.edu\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIRB # 16-2714\r\n\r\nBiomedical\r\n\r\nApproved: 9/14/17",

To qualify, you must have a BMI of 30 or above (formula and link below) and do not exercise for more than 3 hours per week. \r\n\r\n    You will perform submaximal and maximal leg extension exercises of your thigh muscles with sensors taped to your muscles, and size and quality of your thigh muscles will be measured using ultrasonography while you are at rest, and during the strength assessments. For completing both visits associated with this study, you will receive $60 and free health information from the testing.  Please let me know if you have any questions and if you are interested in participating in our study. You can email me at haydeng@live.unc.edu or call me at 919-843-2014.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBMI = Weight (lb) ÷ Height (in) ÷ Height (in) × 703\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHayden Giuliani, MA, ATC, CSCS\r\n\r\nResearch Coordinator\r\n\r\nDepartment of Exercise and Sport Science\r\n\r\nUNC Chapel Hill\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIRB #16-1523\r\n\r\nBiomedical\r\n\r\nApproved: 10/10/2017",

Some questions in this survey ask about eating disorders and disordered eating behaviors and could be triggering. If you become uncomfortable during the survey, you are welcome to end at any time. The survey is anonymous and you will not be contacted about your responses.\r\n\r\nThe survey should take around 10 minutes to answer. If you complete the survey, you can enter to win a prize, including an Amazon Echo product, UNC apparel, Beats headphones, a bluetooth speaker, or a copy of Redemption by Adam Lucas. Each prize has a value between $28 and $150. Should you wish to enter the drawing, your email will not be connected to your survey responses.\r\n\r\nThe survey can be found at this link. Responses should be submitted by March 9, 2018 at 11:59 pm. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about the survey or our project, please reach out to the Executive Branch at executivebranch@unc.edu and your message will be forwarded to the necessary party.\r\n\r\nFurther, if you are concerned about your or a friend’s relationship with food or exercise, resources are available at UNC Campus Health Services, the UNC Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders, and online at the National Eating Disorders Association website.",

Project Uplift is an experiential weekend program for academically gifted rising high school seniors from underrepresented populations, held during Summer Session I.  Uplift PLUS is a five-week program during Carolina’s Summer Session II, in which participants live on campus, attend SAT/ACT coaching sessions, and take English 100 – a 3 credit hour course.\r\n\r\nThese programs provide an opportunity for members of the campus community to get involved and contribute to the rich diversity of Carolina’s applicant pool.  We hope that your unit/school/division will consider getting involved in one or more of the following ways:\r\n\r\nPROJECT UPLIFT (Summer Session I):\r\n\r\nProvide faculty support for a mock classroom – 1 hour\r\nThis session will expose students to the general UNC academic experience.\r\nParticipate in the resource/college fair – 1.25 hours\r\nThis fair will expose students to campus departments and colleges from across the state.\r\nLead an experiential learning session – 1.5 hours (lab, simulation, group project)\r\nThis session will offer hands-on learning opportunities for participants.\r\n\r\nYou can participate in multiple sessions. To find detailed information about each session, to see examples of past sessions, and to sign up, please click here. \r\n\r\n\r\nUPLIFT PLUS (Summer Session II):\r\n\r\nExperiential Learning Session – 1.5 hours (lab, simulation, group project)\r\nThis session will offer the 35 Uplift PLUS participants an in-depth, hands-on, learning opportunity with the goal of exposing participants to a variety of academic subject areas.\r\nThese sessions should be more detailed and differentiated than Project Uplift sessions\r\n\r\nYou can register for multiple sessions that build upon each other. To find detailed information about each session, to see examples of past sessions, and to sign up, please click here. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease sign up no later than Friday, April 20. \r\n\r\nThank you for your continued support of Diversity &amp; Inclusion. Please contact AC Locklear at aclockear@unc.edu if you have questions.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDr. G.

    "content": " \r\n\r\nThe Carolina Women's Center announces that it is now accepting applications for the 2018-2019 Faculty Scholars Program. The program awards three separate grants of $10,000 each to support scholarly or creative research consistent with the priorities of the Carolina Women’s Center. Thus, projects may focus on a wide range of questions. They could explore gendered identities and experiences, including but not limited to femininities, masculinities, and gender non-conforming identities and experiences; intersectional analyses of gender; difference and diversity within and between categories; and gender equity and gender equality. Projects might also bring a gendered analysis to bear on topics seemingly not connected to gender.

However, despite these studies and widespread public and scientific enthusiasm regarding use of such agents in asthmatics, there are little human data to support or refute the use of supplements for either acute or chronic allergic airway disease.\r\n\r\nThis research study is considered a cross-over study, which means that you will take the Vitamin E active supplement for one session, and then take placebo for another session. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSubjects must be otherwise healthy but have mild asthma and allergies. Pregnant or nursing females are excluded. Individuals who are unable to exercise, have had a recent respiratory infection, or have more than 2 asthma exacerbations per week will also be excluded.

    "content": "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Food Allergy Initiative is conducting an industry sponsored phase one clinical trial for peanut allergy. The purpose of this study is to find out if an investigational vaccine for peanut allergy is safe and tolerable for people suffering from peanut allergy. The product being investigated is a vaccine which is injected under the skin in your arm or in your upper arm muscle. The drug being used for this study is ASP0892 (ARA-LAMP_vax), and is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\r\nYou may be eligible for this study if you:\r\n• Are between 18 and 55 years of age\r\n• Have a diagnosed peanut allergy\r\nYou should not participate in this study if you:\r\n• Have any severe uncontrolled disease (lung, endocrine, renal, cardiac, or immune) or disease which prevents you from using epinephrine.\r\n• Are pregnant or nursing or thinking of becoming pregnant.\r\n• Are currently receiving immunotherapy treatment\r\n• Have asthma which is not well controlled\r\n• Have a mental condition such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder or take medication for depression.\r\nOther criteria will be determined over the phone with a study coordinator and at the first clinic visit.\r\nThe study participation will require you to attend our UNC clinic for 13 visits over a period of 8 to 9 months. Most visits will last approximately 4 hours but some visits will take as long as 6 to 8 hours. Study participants will be paid up to $1300 to compensate for time needed for completion of all study activities. A parking voucher will be given to cover the cost of parking at each visit.\r\nIt is important to know that this letter is not telling you to join this study. Your participation is voluntary.

Among more than 20 featured speakers are Howard Markel (Univ. of Michigan), acclaimed social and cultural historian of medicine and public health, and Ralph Baric (UNC-Chapel Hill), global expert in virology and immunology. Gina Kolata, New York Times science and medicine reporter, will deliver the keynote lecture  based on her best-selling book, Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus that Caused It.\r\n\r\nProfessionals, practitioners, researchers, students and others from many fields will be energized by this timely symposium offering perspectives from the vantage points of medicine, health, social sciences and the humanities. Expert speakers from epidemiology, virology, communications, literature, history, ethics, policy and more will look backward and forward to understand the 1918 global influenza pandemic and prevent one with similar or greater virulence in the future. We aim to place the pandemic within the historical context of its time while also recognizing immense changes in society, medicine and public health since 1918. While the potential for another catastrophic global pandemic exists, there are many reasons to anticipate dramatic new discoveries and aspire to a goal of global prevention.\r\n\r\nCo-sponsors include UNC’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, UNC’s Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases, UNC Libraries, the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and RTI International; with the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History collaborating.\r\n\r\nRegistration is now available for the events listed below, via the Going Viral symposium website (https://sph.unc.edu/nciph/1918-flu-symposium/).

    "content": " The UNC Neuromuscular Research Lab is seeking paid volunteers for a research study on anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and reconstruction surgery. Individuals who have injured their ACLs are at a heightened risk of developing knee osteoarthritis, partly because of weakness and dysfunction in the quadriceps muscle. Current rehabilitation approaches are often not effective for restoring quadriceps function due to a neuromuscular factor called arthrogenic muscle inhibition and the fact that the best ways to treat it are unclear.\r\n\r\n Applying vibration to a muscle improves its function and may be an effective way to treat quadriceps dysfunction following ACL injury and reconstruction. The purposes of this research study are to determine if two types of vibration (whole body vibration and local muscle vibration) improve quadriceps muscle function, proprioception (sensation of how your joints are positioned), and walking gait biomechanics in individuals with ACL injuries.\r\n\r\n If you decide to participate, you will be asked to report to the Neuromuscular Research Laboratory on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus for 3 testing sessions. One session will last approximately 45 minutes while the other two will last about an hour and a half. During these testing sessions you will be asked to complete 3 separate tests: 1) quadriceps muscle function, 2) walking gait biomechanics, and 3) sensory function/proprioception. You will then receive an intervention (whole body vibration, local muscle vibration, or control/no vibration) designed to improve these characteristics, and these tests will be repeated. You will also be asked to complete 3 online surveys regarding the details of your initial injury and surgery, your level of physical activity, and any symptoms you currently experience.\r\n\r\n There are some risks associated with participating in this research study, but they are not greater than the risks associated with normal physical activity/exercise.\r\n\r\n To be eligible to participate, you must meet the following inclusion criteria:\r\n\r\nAge 18 – 35 years\r\nHistory of ACL injury and reconstruction in only 1 of your legs within the last 6 months to 5 years\r\nNo history of ACL graft rupture or revision surgery\r\nNo history of injury to either leg within the last 6 months other than ACL injury and reconstruction surgery\r\nNo history of neurological disorder such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or cerebral palsy\r\nCleared by a physician for return to physical activity, and currently physically active, participating in at least 20 minutes of physical activity 3x per week\r\nNot currently pregnant\r\n Your total participation in the study will last approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes, and you will receive $125 for participating.\r\n\r\n If you meet these inclusion criteria and are interested in participating, please contact Chris Johnston at cdjohnst@email.unc.edu.\r\n\r\n This study was approved by the UNC-CH Biomedical Institutional Review Board on 5/18/2015 (IRB# 15-0838). ",

    "content": "Date: Feb. 16, 2018\r\n\r\nTo:  Deans, Directors and Department Chairs (DDD), University Business Managers (UBM) , MOU Financial Leads (MOU)\r\n\r\nFrom:  Janet Rupert, Director of Systems and Operations\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM) has released the state mileage allowances for 2018.\r\n\r\nEffective Jan. 1, 2018, university travelers are obligated to use a State-owned vehicle or vehicle leased through a state contract. When such vehicle is not available, and/or a personal vehicle must be used, the allowable business standard mileage rate is 54.5 cents per mile for trips that do not exceed 100 miles. For business travel trips that utilize personal vehicles and exceed 100 miles per trip, the employee shall be reimbursed at 33 cents per mile. As this policy has shifted in interpretation over the past few years, we are providing a clarification chart and FAQs below to help in interpreting the new policy. See Policy 1310 for more information. \r\n\r\nCharts and FAQs about the New Mileage:\r\n\r\nRound trip does not exceed 100 miles\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n54.5 cents per mile\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRound trip exceeds 100 miles\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTotal round trip will be reimbursed at 33 cents per mile\r\n\r\nQ: I am attending a conference in Richmond, Virginia, and will travel 310 miles to a conference. How do I calculate my mileage?\r\nA:  All university travelers are obligated to use a State-owned vehicle or vehicle leased through a state contract. If such a vehicle is not available and/or a personal vehicle must be utilized, you will be reimbursed for 310 miles at 33 cents per mile, as the trip exceeded 100 miles.\r\n\r\nQ: What if my trip is less than 100 miles?\r\nA: You may be reimbursed for the trip at 54.5 cents per mile, as long as the entire trip is less than 100 miles. If it is more than 100 miles, the reimbursement rate drops to the 33-cent rate for the entire trip.  Under 2018 guidelines, the first 100 miles of a trip are not eligible for the 54.5 cent rate, unless the entire trip does not exceed 100 miles.\r\n\r\nQ:  I have already claimed mileage in January before this memo was issued.  Do I have to reimburse the difference?\r\n\r\nA:  No.  The ConnectCarolina mileage was updated at 5 p.m. on Feb. 15.  Although the State policy was in effect on Jan. 1 of this year, the new rate will not be applied before it was put into our system so that no retro actions need to be taken.",

This research initiative of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health is dedicated to learning more about early child brain development. The BCP will provide an unprecedented view of how a healthy human brain develops and works.\r\n\r\nInclusion Criteria\r\n\r\nBirth at gestational age 37-42 weeks\r\nNormal birth weight\r\nAbsence of any major pregnancy and delivery complications\r\nWhat does this research study involve?\r\n\r\nYour child will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of his/her brain completed at different times in his/her development. These scans will be completed at UNC’s Marsico Hall. During this visit, behavioral assessments will be completed and saliva samples will be obtained. You will also be asked to provide history about you and your child’s medical history, and you will complete questionnaires about your child’s behavior.\r\n\r\nScans will be performed while your child is asleep or awake.  No medication or sedation will be used.\r\n\r\nWill I be paid for participating?\r\n\r\nYou will receive $90 for each visit, and parking will be provided at no cost.\r\n\r\nAre there any risks?\r\n\r\nMRI is a safe and non-invasive way of answering questions about the structural and functional organization of the brain as it develops. It has no known risks and does not use radiation or x-ray.\r\n\r\nWhy participate in this research study?\r\n\r\nYou and your child’s participation in this research study will help us learn more about children’s mental, emotional and behavioral development. It may also help us understand the possible causes of learning disabilities and neurodevelopmental disorders.\r\n\r\nHow can I learn more about joining this research study?\r\n\r\nPlease contact Jordan Jimenez at jordan_jimenez@med.unc.edu or call 919-843-4640 for more information.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis study titled \"Baby Connectome Project\" has been approved by the UNC Biomedical Institutional Review Board (IRB)- study #16-1943, approved 11/03/2017.",

    "content": "Date: Feb. 16, 2018\r\n\r\nTo:  Deans, Directors and Department Chairs (DDD), University Business Managers (UBM) , MOU Financial Leads (MOU)\r\n\r\nFrom:  Janet Rupert, Director of Systems and Operations\r\n\r\nRe:  2018 Travel Mileage Rates\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM) has released the state mileage allowances for 2018.\r\n\r\nEffective Jan. 1, 2018, university travelers are obligated to use a State-owned vehicle or vehicle leased through a state contract. When such vehicle is not available, and/or a personal vehicle must be used, the allowable business standard mileage rate is 54.5 cents per mile for trips that do not exceed 100 miles. For business travel trips that utilize personal vehicles and exceed 100 miles per trip, the employee shall be reimbursed at 33 cents per mile. As this policy has shifted in interpretation over the past few years, we are providing a clarification chart and FAQs below to help in interpreting the new policy. See Policy 1310 for more information. \r\n\r\nCharts and FAQs about the New Mileage:\r\n\r\nRound trip does not exceed 100 miles\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n54.5 cents per mile\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRound trip exceeds 100 miles\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTotal round trip will be reimbursed at 33 cents per mile\r\n\r\nQ: I am attending a conference in Richmond, Virginia, and will travel 310 miles to a conference. How do I calculate my mileage?\r\nA:  All university travelers are obligated to use a State-owned vehicle or vehicle leased through a state contract. If such a vehicle is not available and/or a personal vehicle must be utilized, you will be reimbursed for 310 miles at 33 cents per mile, as the trip exceeded 100 miles.\r\n\r\nQ: What if my trip is less than 100 miles?\r\nA: You may be reimbursed for the trip at 54.5 cents per mile, as long as the entire trip is less than 100 miles. If it is more than 100 miles, the reimbursement rate drops to the 33-cent rate for the entire trip.  Under 2018 guidelines, the first 100 miles of a trip are not eligible for the 54.5 cent rate, unless the entire trip does not exceed 100 miles.\r\n\r\nQ:  I have already claimed mileage in January before this memo was issued.  Do I have to reimburse the difference?\r\nA:  No.  The ConnectCarolina mileage was updated at 5 p.m. on Feb. 15.  Although the State policy was in effect on Jan. 1 of this year, the new rate will not be applied before it was put into our system so that no retro actions need to be taken.\r\n\r\n ",

    "content": "The Ackland Art Museum offers funding to support either a new course or revisions to an existing course that directly engages with the Museum's collection. The Ackland's objective in offering these funds is to further integrate the practice of teaching with works of art into the academic curriculum of the University. Support for these grants comes from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maximum grant available is $5,000. Tenured or tenure-track faculty, fixed term faculty, or lecturers in any discipline may apply. The Ackland's expectation is that the course developed with these funds will be taught three or more times. The course should be taught for the first time during or before the 2019-2020 academic year, and at least twice more within the next five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplicants should submit:\r\n\r\n\r\nA brief description of the course's objectives, its relationship to the applicant's teaching and research interests, the course's significance for the curriculum, and the type of course (e.g. first year seminar, honors seminar, undergraduate lecture course, graduate course, etc.). The description should include a discussion of the role that works of art will play in the course and the relevant objects or area(s) of the Ackland's collection.\r\n\r\nProposed budget and planning timeline. Budget may include expenses such as: instructor salary; graduate student assistance; supplies; course materials; and research related expenses.\r\n\r\nLetter of support from the applicant's department chair.\r\n\r\n2-3 page CV.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplications are due April 2, 2018.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecipient will be notified April 30, 2018.\r\n\r\n\r\nFunds will be available after July 1, 2018.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubmit applications to either:\r\n\r\n\r\nAckland Art Museum\r\n\r\nAcademic Programs: Course Development/Course Enhancement Grants\r\n\r\n\r\nCB#3400\r\n\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n\r\nacklandlearn@unc.edu\r\n",

Please submit electronic nominations to Hettleman_award@unc.edu and hard copy material to the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research, 312 South Building. \r\n\r\nVice Chancellor for Research Terry Magnuson and the selection committee, which is comprised of six professors -- three from the Division of Academic Affairs and three from the Division of Health Affairs – will forward a list of recommendations to me. The announcements of the prizes will be made at the first Faculty Council meeting of the fall term of 2018.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to help recognize and reward the work of Carolina’s most promising young faculty.",

Most recently this has included studying abnormalities in young, autistic children and children and adolescents at high risk for schizophrenia. Her lab explores the behavioral and neurophysiological underpinnings of sensory and cognitive impairments across neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopment disorders. Throughout her career, she has forged faculty collaborations throughout UNC and other institutions to better understand the effects of early childhood adversity on neurocognitive maturation.\r\n\r\nHer extensive experience, coupled with her incredible energy, will serve the Institute well as FPG continues to expand its portfolio of research and services. As director, Dr. Belger will provide administrative oversight and work with the FPG leadership team, investigative groups, and staff to advance the Institute’s research, provide technical assistance and consultation, and facilitate community outreach. One of the nation's oldest and largest multidisciplinary centers devoted to the study of young children and their families, FPG is world-renown for not only the research it conducts, but also the efficiency in which this knowledge is then put into practice through the Institutes efforts.\r\n\r\nDr. Belger’s anticipated start date is April 1, 2018. She will be working with Interim Director Stephen Hooper over the next few months to ensure a smooth leadership transition.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in welcoming Ayse to her new role.",

This research initiative of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health is dedicated to learning more about early child brain development. The BCP will provide an unprecedented view of how a healthy human brain develops and works.\r\n\r\nInclusion Criteria\r\n\r\nBirth at gestational age 37-42 weeks\r\nNormal birth weight\r\nAbsence of any major pregnancy and delivery complications\r\nWhat does this research study involve?\r\n\r\nYour child will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of his/her brain completed at different times in his/her development. These scans will be completed at UNC’s Marsico Hall. During this visit, behavioral assessments will be completed and saliva samples will be obtained. You will also be asked to provide history about you and your child’s medical history, and you will complete questionnaires about your child’s behavior.\r\n\r\nScans will be performed while your child is asleep or awake.  No medication or sedation will be used.\r\n\r\nWill I be paid for participating?\r\n\r\nYou will receive $90 for each visit, and parking will be provided at no cost.\r\n\r\nAre there any risks?\r\n\r\nMRI is a safe and non-invasive way of answering questions about the structural and functional organization of the brain as it develops. It has no known risks and does not use radiation or x-ray.\r\n\r\nWhy participate in this research study?\r\n\r\nYou and your child’s participation in this research study will help us learn more about children’s mental, emotional and behavioral development. It may also help us understand the possible causes of learning disabilities and neurodevelopmental disorders.\r\n\r\nHow can I learn more about joining this research study?\r\n\r\nPlease contact Jordan Jimenez at jordan_jimenez@med.unc.edu or call 919-843-4640 for more information.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis study titled \"Baby Connectome Project\" has been approved by the UNC Biomedical Institutional Review Board (IRB)- study #16-1943, approved 11/03/2017.",

    "content": "\r\nDear Carolina Community:\r\n\r\nI am pleased to announce that Laurie Mesibov has agreed to take on the additional duties and responsibilities of Interim Director of the University’s Ombuds Office, effective February 8. I asked Laurie to take on this role when Wayne Blair leaves the position of director today, February 7.  \r\n\r\nLaurie, who has worked as the Associate University Ombuds and served alongside Wayne since 2005, will be assisted by Victoria Dowd. Laurie is a long-time faculty member in our School of Government. Her leadership roles include working in the Office of the Provost from 1996-2000; serving as an advisor to the SPA Grievance Panels; and membership on the Faculty Grievance Committee, Faculty Executive Committee, and over 20 years of service on the Truman Scholarship Selection Committee. \r\n\r\nThe University Ombuds Office plays a key role in supporting intellectual freedom, promoting personal integrity and justice, and pursuing values that foster enlightened leadership and mutually beneficial interactions between all members of our community. The office is a safe space to discuss any University-related issues, problems, or disputes and is available to all students, faculty, staff, and administrators. The Ombuds Office is also available to all units on campus for conflict management training. \r\n\r\nIt is important to have an experienced leader with Laurie’s background and first-hand knowledge of our University’s initiatives continuing the dedicated work of the office. There is no one more capable to take on that responsibility. Laurie’s background makes her uniquely qualified to build on the reputation and record of the University Ombud’s office as a confidential and safe place to visit where all feel welcome. \r\n\r\nA committee has been appointed to search for candidates to lead the University’s Ombuds Office. In the meantime, I am grateful to Laurie Mesibov for assuming the interim leadership role of this critically important office that benefits all members of our campus community.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCarol L. Folt\r\nChancellor\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "Hello!\r\n\r\nMy name is Laura Stanley, and I am a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am writing to recruit participants for a research study entitled The Acute Effects of an Isometric Loading Intervention on Lower Extremity Landing Biomechanics in Individuals with Patellar Tendinopathy. This research is supported by the Foundation for Physical Therapy, and will be conducted by researchers from the University of North Carolina in the Department of Exercise and Sport Science. This project has received ethics approval from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Biomedical Institutional Review Board (IRB #17-1731, approval date 9/15/17).\r\n\r\nKnee tendon pain, or tendinopathy, is common in athletes participating in sports that involve high volumes of jumping, landing, and cutting. Little is known about how movement biomechanics differ between individuals with and without tendinopathy, and if using simple leg strengthening exercises can influence movement biomechanics. The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in biomechanical and cumulative external load profiles, and the acute response to isometric loading in individuals with and without patellar tendinopathy. We are recruiting male athletes both with and without tendinopathy, between 15-28 years-old, and who are currently participating in competitive sports. \r\n\r\nThis study will be conducted via three testing sessions during which we will measure the structure of the patellar tendon using non-invasive ultrasound, assessing knee pain symptoms, tracking physical activity for a one-week period, and evaluating the effects of a simple leg strengthening exercise protocol on movement profiles using motion capture technology. Eligible participants will be compensated $75 for participation.\r\n\r\nWe would love to provide you with further information on this research study. If you are interested in learning more, please contact me at lstanley@unc.edu (email).\r\n\r\nThank you! \r\n\r\nLaura Stanley PT, DPT, SCS\r\n\r\nPhD Candidate, Human Movement Science\r\n\r\nThe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\r\n\r\nSports Medicine Research Laboratory\r\n\r\nOffice: 919.962.7187\r\n\r\nEmail: lstanley@unc.edu",

If you complete the survey and write your name, you will automatically be entered into a raffle for one of two $50 Amazon gift cards that will be awarded at the end of the survey collection period.\r\n\r\nBy clicking here https://unc.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3wIlw3AjpaJlnHT and completing the survey, you agree to be a participant in this study.\r\n\r\nThe survey will ask you questions about your experiences with the UL’s overdue fines policy and is completely voluntary. You may choose not to participate or stop taking the survey at anytime. All possible measures have been taken to protect the confidentiality of your answers.\r\n \r\nI will report only summaries of the aggregated data.  This means that your responses will be combined with all of the other responses received and will not be able to be identified as yours. Deductive disclosure which is the discerning of an individual respondent's identity and responses through the use of known characteristics of that individual is also possible but unlikely.\r\n \r\nIf you have any questions regarding this survey, you may contact me via email at ameleak@email.unc.edu.\r\n\r\nAll research on human volunteers is reviewed by a committee that works to protect your rights and welfare. This non-biomedical study, ID 17 - 2654, was approved on 1/26/2018 by the Office of Human Research Ethics at UNC-Chapel Hill. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your rights as a research subject you may contact, anonymously if you wish, the Institutional Review Board at (919) 966-3113 or via email at IRB_subjects@unc.edu with study number 17 – 2654.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAmelea Kim",

    "content": "Good afternoon, \r\n\r\nOur organization, Mental Health Ambassadors, strives to encourage open dialogue about mental health and familiarize students with a variety of counseling resources on campus. \r\n\r\nAs part of this mission, we have created a variety of memos on several mental health issues students may face during their years at Carolina. Topics include: Chronic stress, eating disorders, exam stress and student failure. \r\n\r\nEach memo includes a list of behaviors to look for and tips on how to address the issue. As professors, we encourage you to implement these into your Sakai pages or future syllabi. \r\n\r\nProfessors have a profound effect on the college experience. Students interact with faculty daily and build trusting relationships with their professors. Due to the daily interaction students have with faculty, it is likely professors may notice these mental health concerns in their students and have the opportunity to intervene. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, we have attached the memos here and encourage their use in creating a dialogue on campus and ensuring the mental wellness of every student on campus. \r\n\r\nThe memos are linked here.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration.",

    "content": "Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:\r\n\r\nInfluenza, “flu,” activity continues to increase and is widespread in 49 states, including North Carolina. The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by Influenza viruses, which can cause mild to severe illness. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting vaccinated each year. The season can last until May, so there is still time to get vaccinated.\r\n\r\nFlu vaccinations are still available at the Student Stores Pharmacy and Campus Health Pharmacy for students, faculty and staff. Or, you can find a flu clinic off campus by going to flu.nc.gov.\r\n\r\nHelp prevent the spread of the flu on campus by recognizing the symptoms and staying at home. The flu spreads by coughing and sneezing and by touching infected surfaces. Someone with the flu can be infectious one day before symptoms and up to seven days after becoming ill.\r\n\r\nTake actions to reduce the spread of germs: \r\n\r\nStay home until 24 hours after your fever is gone, except to seek medical care.\r\nCover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and put your used tissue in a wastebasket.\r\nCough or sneeze into your upper sleeve — not your hands — if you don’t have a tissue.\r\nWash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be used if soap and water are not available. \r\nStay healthy by getting adequate sleep, eating nutrient-dense foods and staying hydrated.\r\nLearn more at Campus Health’s website and at flu.unc.edu.   ",

    "content": "\r\nDear Carolina Community, \r\n\r\nI am writing to inform you of our plans to expand the use of 2-Step Verification on campus in 2018. This continues the work that ITS has already completed to put select digital resources, such as the online W2, VPN and administrative IT applications, behind 2-Step Verification protection. A great many in our community are routinely using 2-Step Verification successfully today. \r\n\r\nWe do, however, need 2-Step Verification in more places. As many of you saw over the 2017 Thanksgiving break, criminals continue to use phishing messages to access accounts. This is true at UNC-Chapel Hill and across higher education. In November 2017, phishers successfully compromised several hundred Onyens and passwords by phishing student, faculty and staff accounts. Criminals used that access to launch thousands of additional attacks here on campus. 2-Step Verification would have stopped these attacks, saved our community the headaches associated with re-authenticating accounts, and saved the University time and money.   \r\n\r\nWhat is 2-Step Verification? \r\n\r\n2-Step Verification -- also called multifactor or two-factor authentication -- is an additional layer of protection for your accounts. 2-Step Verification utilizes something you know (your Onyen and password) and something you have (e.g. your phone).  \r\n\r\nMany of you are likely already using 2-Step Verification for online activity with bank accounts, credit cards and personal email accounts. If you've received a code sent to your phone before you could sign in to an account, you have used 2-Step Verification. \r\n\r\nWhy is 2-Step Verification Important? \r\n\r\nThe main benefit of activating 2-Step is that it significantly increases the protection of your account from hackers. Here’s how that is achieved: \r\n\r\n2-Step adds an extra barrier between your personal information and unwarranted access. To access your account, criminals would need to know your username and password as well as a security code; \r\n2-Step can help keep criminals from accessing your email, documents, payroll, personal information or research data, even if your Onyen and password have been stolen; \r\n2-Step requires a unique security code each time your account is accessed on a non-trusted device, application or web browser. \r\nAction Required \r\n\r\nOur 2018 implementations begin with a focus on student use of Office 365 and ConnectCarolina access. In the coming weeks and months, students will hear more about 2-Step Verification, including how to activate 2-Step, how to set up devices, how to find support and other valuable information.

Start your semester off right with not one, but two plays in rotation that offer the best the of old and new: a madcap runway romp through Molière’s classic comedy Tartuffe and The Christians, an award-winning contemporary drama.\r\n\r\nA rich fool, an religious con man, a thwarted love affair, and the unflappable woman who is determined to set them all straight come to vibrant life in David Ball’s new adaptation of Tartuffe. In The Christians, Tony-nominated playwright Lucas Hnath asks, “How much are you willing to give up for what you believe?” as certainty and doubt come to a head for one megachurch pastor and his congregation.\r\n\r\nSee one. See both. Bring a friend and immerse yourself in the storytelling experience that has remained central to the human experience since the the first “big fish” story ever told.\r\n\r\nThese stories about both the ridiculous and sobering sides of faith, doubt, and following are both on stage in rotation from February 1 through March 11.\r\n\r\nNEW THIS SEASON: Login with your ONYEN to purchase tickets online!

    "content": "The University of North Carolina offers a choice of voluntary supplemental retirement programs so employees can save additional amounts for retirement. Under The University of North Carolina Section 403(b) Plan (“the 403(b) Plan”), eligible employees may elect to defer a portion of their compensation to the 403(b) Plan on a pre-tax or post-tax (Roth) basis.\r\n\r\nThe 403(b) Plan is designed to help you invest more money today so that you have the income you need in your retirement years. It provides a supplement to either the N.C. Teachers’ and State Employees’ Retirement System or the UNC Optional Retirement Program, the State’s mandatory retirement plans available to permanent employees who work 30 or more hours per week. Moreover, even employees not eligible for one of the mandatory retirement plans may also be able to make voluntary contributions to the 403(b) Plan.\r\n\r\nEligibility\r\nAll employees, other than UNC HealthCare employees, who receive compensation reportable on a Form W-2 and pay FICA (Social Security) tax are eligible to participate in the 403(b) Plan, so long as the employee elects to contribute at least $200 each calendar year.\r\n\r\nContributions\r\nAn eligible employee may elect to defer a portion of his or her compensation on a pre-tax or post-tax (Roth) basis.\r\n\r\nPre-tax Contributions\r\nBoth federal and state income taxes are deferred on the contributions and any earnings until distributed from the Plan. Distributions are taxable as ordinary income for federal and state income tax purposes. Generally, a participant must begin receiving a distribution by April 1 following the later of the year in they turn age 70½ or terminate employment with The University.\r\n\r\nPost-tax Contributions (Roth)\r\nFederal and state income taxes are withheld from Roth contributions at the time that they are contributed to the Plan. Contributions are not taxed again at distribution.\r\n\r\nMoreover, any earnings on the contributions are never subject to federal and state income taxes upon distribution, as long as a five year period has passed since Roth contributions were first made to the Plan and the distribution is a “qualified distribution”. A qualified distribution is a distribution (i) made on or after the date on which the participant attains age 59 ½, (ii) made to a beneficiary on or after the death of the participant, or (iii) made on or after the participant becomes disabled.\r\n\r\nContribution Limits\r\nAnnual contribution limits are set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS allows an eligible employee to make an additional catch-up contribution beginning in the year in which he or she turns age 50. For 2018, the calendar year limits under the 403(b) Plan is as follows:\r\n\r\nCalendar Year Annual Contribution Limit:\r\n\r\n$18,500*\r\n\r\nAge 50+ Catch-up Contribution Limit:\r\n\r\n$6,000*\r\n\r\n*Note: This is a combined limit for pre-tax and Roth after-tax contributions.\r\n\r\nApproved Vendors\r\nThe University has approved Fidelity Investments and TIAA as the two financial services companies offering options under the 403(b) Plan. Fidelity and TIAA provide a wide range of mutual fund investment options and annuity products through their own funds as well as other investment managers.\r\n\r\nBoth companies offer resources and tools to help participants plan their investment strategy. Eligible employees should contact each vendor for information about plan investment options and services provided.\r\n\r\nFidelity Investments\r\n\r\n1-800-343-0860\r\n\r\nTIAA\r\n\r\n1-800-842-2252\r\n\r\nEnrollment Process\r\nEligible employees may enroll immediately upon date of hire or at any time. To start the enrollment process, please visit the UNC System Voluntary 403(b) Retirement Program webpage and follow the steps listed:\r\n\r\nStep 1 – Complete a Salary Reduction Agreement (SRA) (forms and instructions available on the website)\r\nStep 2 – Enroll in the plan with Fidelity and/or TIAA\r\nContributions may be designated as a percent of salary or as a flat dollar amount depending on your campus payroll capability. The SRA will apply only to amounts earned after enrolling in the Plan, and an employee’s election under the SRA will continue until the SRA is modified or revoked by the employee.\r\n\r\nModifying a Deferral Election\r\nAn eligible employee may increase, decrease or stop his or her future contributions to the plan at any time by completing an SRA. Employees may also change from one vendor to another at any time by completing an SRA to stop contributions with the existing vendor, and following the steps above to enter into a new agreement with another vendor. It is also possible to make contributions to more than one vendor at a time.\r\n\r\nMore Information\r\nIf you have questions about the 403(b) Plan, please contact your campus Benefits Representative or visit the UNC System Voluntary 403(b) Retirement Program webpage.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis notice is provided as a source of information and does not constitute legal, tax or other professional advice. If legal advice, tax advice or other professional assistance is required, the services of a professional advisor should be sought. Every effort has been made to make this notice as thorough and accurate as possible. However, there are other legal documents, laws, and regulations that govern the operation of the Program.

A qualified distribution is a distribution (i) made on or after the date on which the participant attains age 59 ½, (ii) made to a beneficiary on or after the death of the participant, or (iii) made on or after the participant becomes disabled.\r\n\r\nContribution Limits\r\nAnnual contribution limits are set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS allows an eligible employee to make an additional catch-up contribution beginning in the year in which he or she turns age 50. For 2018, the calendar year limits under the 403(b) Plan is as follows:\r\n\r\nCalendar Year Annual Contribution Limit:\t$18,500*\r\nAge 50+ Catch-up Contribution Limit:\t$6,000*\r\n*Note: This is a combined limit for pre-tax and Roth after-tax contributions.\r\n\r\nApproved Vendors\r\nThe University has approved Fidelity Investments and TIAA as the two financial services companies offering options under the 403(b) Plan. Fidelity and TIAA provide a wide range of mutual fund investment options and annuity products through their own funds as well as other investment managers.\r\n\r\nBoth companies offer resources and tools to help participants plan their investment strategy. Eligible employees should contact each vendor for information about plan investment options and services provided.\r\n\r\nFidelity Investments\t1-800-343-0860\r\nTIAA\t1-800-842-2252\r\nEnrollment Process\r\nEligible employees may enroll immediately upon date of hire or at any time. To start the enrollment process, please visit the UNC System Voluntary 403(b) Retirement Program webpage and follow the steps listed:\r\n\r\nStep 1 – Complete a Salary Reduction Agreement (SRA) (forms and instructions available on the website)\r\nStep 2 – Enroll in the plan with Fidelity and/or TIAA\r\nContributions may be designated as a percent of salary or as a flat dollar amount depending on your campus payroll capability. The SRA will apply only to amounts earned after enrolling in the Plan, and an employee’s election under the SRA will continue until the SRA is modified or revoked by the employee.\r\n\r\nModifying a Deferral Election\r\nAn eligible employee may increase, decrease or stop his or her future contributions to the plan at any time by completing an SRA. Employees may also change from one vendor to another at any time by completing an SRA to stop contributions with the existing vendor, and following the steps above to enter into a new agreement with another vendor. It is also possible to make contributions to more than one vendor at a time.\r\n\r\nMore Information\r\nIf you have questions about the 403(b) Plan, please contact your campus Benefits Representative or visit the UNC System Voluntary 403(b) Retirement Program webpage.\r\n\r\nThis notice is provided as a source of information and does not constitute legal, tax or other professional advice. If legal advice, tax advice or other professional assistance is required, the services of a professional advisor should be sought. Every effort has been made to make this notice as thorough and accurate as possible. However, there are other legal documents, laws, and regulations that govern the operation of the Program.

    "content": "\r\nDear Carolina Faculty and Staff:\r\n\r\nWe make every effort to build and support a diverse and inclusive workplace where our faculty and staff can succeed. The same is true for all institutions in the UNC System. To that end, I am writing today to encourage you to participate in a survey that can help us gauge and enhance your experience as a Carolina employee.\r\n\r\nThe UNC System Strategic Plan includes a goal to foster diverse and excellent institutions. Toward this goal, for the next five years, each institution in the UNC System will participate in an annual system-wide survey to gather input about workplace engagement.\r\n\r\nThe survey, which will be emailed to you on January 29, is designed for full-time employees, and the goal is to gain clearer measurements for success that will assist us with the recruitment, retention, and development of the most talented and diverse workforce possible—both as a system and on our campus. We want to develop a workforce that is prepared to meet the changing needs of the University—a priority in the UNC System Strategic Plan and our campus’s The Blueprint for Next strategic framework. In the survey, you will be asked for your thoughts about topics like communications, collaboration, supervision and benefits, among other items. The survey will come from ModernThink LLC, an independent research and consulting firm that specializes in higher education.\r\n\r\nI encourage each of you to share your honest feedback, and your responses will remain anonymous. As a thank you, more than 100 respondents will be chosen at random to receive incentives, including tickets to campus events, gift cards and other prizes. Over the summer, we will receive and share reports that summarize the data provided so that we can recognize our successes and begin to address concerns that most directly influence our workplace culture.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about the survey, please email engagement@unc.edu or visit our engagement website for information and updates about this important multi-year initiative. Thank you in advance for your participation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarol L. Folt\r\nChancellor",

    "content": "\r\nDear Campus Community,\r\n\r\nIn 2016, we announced a series of named scholarships, called Noteworthy Firsts, recognizing the service of courageous people who represent important “firsts” in our history. Today, I am writing with an exciting announcement about a new way Carolina is honoring a special group of people.\r\n\r\nSoon, our next class of incoming students will receive their acceptances and those who qualify may find themselves the recipient of a scholarship named for an individual who played an important role in Carolina’s history. These need-based awards are named for Bridge Builders – people whose work, advocacy and personal example forged a more inclusive, unified and aspirational Carolina community.\r\n\r\nIn the fall, I asked the campus community to help me identify Bridge Builders who helped us fulfill our mission to be the university of the people. From these recommendations, a panel of our leaders identified 19 extraordinary people who truly represented the values that define Carolina. \r\n\r\nThe scholarships will recognize people like Larry D. Keith, who paved the way for hundreds of students of color to succeed in the health professions when he served as Director of the Medical Education Development program. Another example is Susie Marshall Sharp, the first woman to serve as Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. Nikole Hannah-Jones – a Peabody Award-winning journalist and one of the founders of the Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting – is another sterling example of service to Carolina and beyond that is recognized through the Bridge Builders scholarship opportunity. A full list of Bridge Builders can be found here.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to read the biographies of all the Bridge Builders and learn more about those who helped create the Carolina we know today. I know their stories will motivate you to succeed in your own personal journeys at Carolina.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarol L. Folt\r\nChancellor\r\n\r\n ",

Please note that students must still see the appropriate department and advisors to add a course at this point in the semester. \r\n\r\nWe hope this extension allows more time for students to make enrollment decisions. Please let us know if you have any questions by emailing Registrar@unc.edu or calling 919-962-3954. \r\n\r\nThank you and have a great day!\r\n\r\nLauren DiGrazia\r\n\r\nAssistant Provost &amp; University Registrar Office of the University Registrar\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "\r\nDear Carolina Community,\r\n\r\nI am pleased to announce that we have selected Jonathan Pruitt, a proven leader in financial and operational efficiency, as the next Vice Chancellor for Finance and Operations. Jonathan, who was until recently the chief financial officer for the UNC System, will fill the position that Matt Fajack will vacate in February.\r\n\r\nJonathan will begin his new role on January 29.  He will serve as a valued partner to me and the rest of our senior leadership, helping to implement the Blueprint for Next, the University’s first overarching strategic framework, and new budget and business strategies that will guide and support our growth and future direction.\r\n\r\nWe are extremely fortunate to be able to fill this critical position quickly and with someone who is already intimately familiar with the University and its operations, as well as the state budget process.  Jonathan’s existing relationships with members of the UNC System and the state legislature will ensure a smooth transition into his new role. At this critical time on our campus, as universities face new challenges in growth and budgeting, Jonathan’s stellar credentials and expertise will help shepherd us through our next chapter and ensure we remain the leading 21st-century public research institution.\r\n\r\nAs Vice Chancellor of Finance and Operations, Jonathan will be responsible for oversight of campus-wide financial planning and budgeting; treasury and risk management; facilities planning, construction and operations; real estate development; purchasing; public safety; campus enterprises; environment health and safety; and energy services.\r\n\r\nJonathan joined the UNC System in 2006. In his role, he was responsible for the finance and business affairs of UNC General Administration, managing an operating budget of $10 billion. His role required him to work collaboratively with the UNC Board of Governors, state government, UNC General Administration staff and chief financial officers from the 17 campuses of the UNC System to accomplish strategic financial and operational priorities.\r\n\r\nJonathan is from Pikeville, Kentucky, and received his bachelor of arts degree from Centre College and his master of public administration degree from the University of Kentucky. He began his career as a senior associate of finance for the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education and as a policy and budget analyst for the Office for Policy and Management.\r\n\r\nWe are thrilled to have Jonathan on board and I know the Tar Heel community will join me in congratulating him on his new role.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBob Blouin\r\nProvost",

Remember that 2-Step Verification is required for online W-2 access (see 2-Step instructions below). In late January 2018, all employees will also receive a printed W-2 for tax year 2017.\r\n\r\nAccessing online W-2s offers the following advantages:\r\n\r\nAccessing your W-2 form online allows you to print and use it sooner than the paper version issued in late January by Payroll Services.\r\nActive employees can access and print their W-2s at any time, 24 hours a day. The functionality can be especially useful for employees who need to access their W-2 information quickly when applying for personal loans.\r\nThe electronic W-2 is just as official as the paper version you normally receive from Payroll Services – no special paper is needed.\r\nFormer employees will continue to receive paper W-2s via U.S. Mail and also have the option of accessing W-2s via a guest account in ConnectCarolina. Instructions can be found at help.unc.edu/help/onyens-guest-ids/.\r\n\r\nInstructions for accessing your W-2 online using 2-Step:\r\n\r\nVisit onyen.unc.edu and click \"Register &amp; Manage 2-Step Verification.\" The registration process for 2-Step takes just 10 minutes. Have your PID available and your mobile device or landline phone with you. Follow the steps to select and confirm your preferred 2-Step method (a text message, landline phone call or a “push” notification). Then visit ConnectCarolina to access your online W-2 via the SelfService menu.\r\n\r\nAlready registered for 2-Step but have a new device?\r\n\r\nAre you already registered for 2-Step, but need a refresher on how to activate a new device? Click the \"New Devices\" tab on this help document: help.unc.edu/help/duo/ for step-by-step instructions. \r\n\r\nWant to learn more? \r\n\r\nYou can visit its.unc.edu/2-step to learn more about 2-Step on our campus, why it's important and how it keeps you and Carolina secure.\r\n\r\nQuestions or problems?\r\n\r\nHelp Documentation related to 2-Step, including step-by-step instructions, is available by visiting: help.unc.edu/help/duo/.\r\nStep-by-step instructions and user tips related to viewing and printing W-2 forms can be found on the ConnectCarolina User Information website, Online Employee Tax Forms page: ccinfo.unc.edu/featured-resources/online-employee-tax-forms/.\r\n• If you have questions concerning your W-2 form, please visit our W-2 frequently-asked questions webpage, finance.unc.edu/departments/strategic-sourcing-payment/payroll/w-2/.\r\nIf you have technical problems viewing or printing your W-2, contact the Help Desk at 962-HELP. \r\n\r\n",

    "content": "Hello! \r\n\r\nIf you are a First-Year student interested in a unique leadership opportunity, continue reading! \r\n\r\nEach year, the North Carolina Fellows Program welcomes a group of around twenty-five students from the first-year class into our community. But what is the North Carolina Fellows Program?  \r\n\r\nNC Fellows is a leadership development group centered around discussion-based learning and exposure to new ideas. Students apply during their first year at Carolina and remain in the program through their senior year. Fellows will interact in the program both with the students in their class year (their cohort) as well as with members from all years in the group.  \r\n\r\nAt the core of NC Fellows are Monthly Meetings, in which Fellows of all years meet to discuss new topics, listen and interact with speakers, or participate in workshops. Topics run the gamut from issues of social justice to questions of community to explorations of art. These meetings are always accompanied by dinner, so that Fellows can engage in fellowship with one another in a less formal setting. \r\n\r\nPart of what makes NC Fellows so unique is its combination of co-curricular with extra-curricular. In addition to Monthly Meetings, students will also have the opportunity to enroll in multiple leadership development classes at UNC for academic credit. Incoming sophomores will take EDUC 309, a course focused on leadership theory and practice that serves to better acquaint Fellows with the program and their cohort. These studies come full circle in one's senior year with EDUC 317, a capstone course designed to conclude one's time in Fellows.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to monthly meetings, all Fellows attend an annual leadership retreat at the beginning of the year. The retreat sets the stage for the program as it moves into a new year, while giving Fellows a chance to re-connect with each other and to meet the incoming sophomore cohort. During their junior year, Fellows will also attend an alternative Fall Break oriented around service, adding an additional element of community engagement to their time in the program.  \r\n\r\nIf any or all of this program sounds exciting to you, we welcome you to apply! Fellows is not restricted to any specific major or discipline. Rather, we seek thoughtful individuals of all backgrounds, those with open minds, self-awareness, passion, and creativity in all forms.  \r\n\r\nThe application is now open on HeelLife, and can be accessed via this link: http://unc.live/2AcH3Be. The application closes on Jan. 31, 2018. If you are having trouble accessing the application, please send an email to ncfellows@gmail.com. The Interview Day will be on Saturday, Feb. 24th, 2018 from 10 AM to 4 PM. You will be notified if you are selected for Interview Day on Feb. 12th, 2018. If you are selected for Interview Day, you must attend. You will be notified of your final status on March 5th, 2018. Best of luck! \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nThe NC Fellows Selection Committee ",

Through this program, we bring together investigators from across diverse disciplines, focusing the power of convergence to yield new knowledge and simulate innovation to solve emerging problems and shape the future.\r\n\r\nI’m excited to share with you that after the call for pre-proposals was issued in November, our office received 38 submissions, involving 194 UNC researchers representing 35 departments across 10 schools and the College.\r\n\r\nOf those submissions, the OVCR has chosen seven semi-finalists who will go on to develop comprehensive proposals and publicly present their innovative approaches in March. The goals of the semi-finalist proposals include:\r\n\r\nApplying novel statistical models to drive healthcare predictive analytics, inform decision-making, and optimize chronic disease treatment.\r\nAddressing “how epigenetics contribute to life” by utilizing chemical biology tools to empower researchers to gain insights in epigenetics to advance fundamental understanding in biology and pathways to treat disease\r\nCollaborating intra-institutionally to examine the long-term effects of environmental exposure on health.\r\nInvestigating heterogeneity of the etiology of obesity and its clinical health consequences and responses by conducting integrated science across basic, clinical, and population research.\r\nBridging humanists and data scientists by providing better access to data tools and methodologies, and developing interventions that correct or limit misinformation to improve social media exchanges and influence public policy on science and health.\r\nCreating a data-driven platform for designing and making bio-mimetic materials to be used in individually tailored medical devices and implants.\r\nDeveloping novel, affordable and scalable graphene-polymer nanocomposites as membranes for water purification, energy generation, and energy storage applications\r\nOf these novel projects, we hope to fund two finalists in April to receive up to $500,000 in funding from OVCR to execute their proposal over the next two years.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Creativity Hub awardees are guaranteed proposal development assistance from the Office of Research Development (ORD) to pursue large-scale, follow-on awards that spring from the program’s funding. Of those pre-proposals that were not selected, many were excellent, and ORD will work with these groups to further build their projects and connect to other funding opportunities.\r\n\r\nPlease visit the program website to learn more about these innovative projects and creative teams: http://research.unc.edu/creativity-hubs/\r\n\r\nI look forward to sharing with you the finalist for the first round of Creativity Hubs in April.",

    "content": "Subject: Early Development and Sleep Research Study\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nThe Frohlich Lab, a leader in brain network dynamics at UNC, has an exciting research study that your infant/toddler between the ages of 12-30 months can participate in with just 2 short sessions.\r\n\r\n In this research study, we are examining sleep characteristics in infants/toddlers that may have:\r\n\r\n-Language delays (i.e., no words at 18 months, limited vocalizations at 12 months)\r\n\r\n-Delays in social communication or play                   \r\n\r\n-Autism or who are at-risk for autism (have a sibling with autism). \r\n\r\nChildren develop and change rapidly during infancy and toddlerhood. We know that sleep is a critical aspect of health and brain development. However, little has been done to document patterns of sleep in young children or examine how brain activity during sleep may differ in children with delays and children with autism.\r\n\r\n~You may be eligible if:\r\n\r\nYour family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months with language delays (i.e., no words at 18 months, limited vocalizations at 12 months)\r\n. Your family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months with delays in social communication or play\r\n\r\n.  Your family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months with an autism spectrum disorder.\r\n\r\nYour family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months who has an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder.\r\n \r\n\r\n~We schedule the two visits at your convenience and you will be with your child at all times. Each visit will take about 2- 2 ½ hours. The types of activities involved:\r\n\r\n. A visit to your home at your convenience: Infant developmental assessments\r\n\r\n. A visit to the nap room: Non-invasive recording (brain rhythms) during a midday nap. Your child will be playing with a variety of toys and taking a nap. This location offers free parking. \r\n\r\nWe will compensate you $75 for your time. For more information, or to see if your child is eligible, please call Jessica Page at 919-445-0227 or email jessica.page@unc.edu or EDS@med.unc.edu.  You can find out more on our website at http://www.frohlichlab.org/.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your participation!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frohlich Lab\r\n                        This study was approved by the UNC biomedical IRB on 1/29/17 (IRB # 15-1829)",

The research team I am working with consists of Dr. Eric Ryan, Dr. Joe Myers, Dr. Tony Hackney, and Dr. David Berkoff. We are reaching out to you in hopes that you can participate in a research study entitled “Non-invasive Assessment of Overuse Injury Mechanisms in the Adolescent Athlete.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are looking for healthy male baseball players between the ages of 13 – 18. To qualify for this study, pitcher must be or have been your primary or secondary position. You must not be injured, or have pain or discomfort that has limited your baseball participation for the last 3 months. You can have no previous shoulder or elbow surgery in the past year, and must be able to pitch the age recommended amount of pitches based on USA Baseball’s Pitch Smart guidelines. The purpose of this research study is to determine if ultrasound imaging of the infraspinatus, a shoulder muscle, can show how muscles recover following a bout of baseball pitching.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs a participant, you will be required to sign an informed consent document stating you understand all of the procedures and rights as a research subject, and to fill out questionnaires regarding your baseball participation, injuries, and training. The study includes 4 testing visits over the course of 6 days. Your first visit will involve filling out the paperwork and performing the baseline assessment which will consist of a finger stick blood draw, shoulder range of motion and strength measures, and an ultrasound image of your infraspinatus, a muscle critical to baseball pitching. These images are taken with an ultrasound machine. Diagnostic ultrasound creates an image using sound waves, so no radiation or damaging imaging will be used with this study.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFollowing the baseline testing, you will immediately pitch an age prescribed amount of pitches based on USA Baseball’s Pitch Smart guidelines. Once the pitch count is reached, the same testing procedures will be performed again. You will be asked to return on day 1, day 3, and day 5 following your bout of pitching, where the exact same assessments will be performed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nParticipants can receive up to $100 dollars in compensation. If you are interested or have questions, please contact Brett Pexa by phone or email.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBrett Pexa\r\n\r\n919-843-2014\r\n\r\npexa@live.unc.edu\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIRB #: 16-2714\r\n\r\nDate Approved: 3/2/2017\r\n\r\nBiomedical",

He is an international expert in child neuropsychology and has dedicated his research, community outreach, and clinical service activities to developmental disabilities, genetic disorders in children, and pediatric chronic illnesses. He currently maintains federal funding with a variety of agencies including the Institute for Educational Science and the National Institutes for Health.\r\n\r\nAs Interim Director of FPG, Dr. Hooper will provide overall administrative oversight. He will also work with the FPG leadership team, investigative groups, and staff to facilitate ongoing projects that advance the Institute’s research, provide technical assistance and consultation, and facilitate community outreach.\r\n\r\nDr. Odom will continue to serve FPG as a senior research scientist and as an integral part of FPG’s formidable team of autism experts — a team he himself helped to build as director.\r\n\r\nDuring Dr. Odom’s tenure, he oversaw the generation of more than 600 peer-reviewed publications and hundreds of book chapters, reports, and policy briefs produced by FPG scientists and specialists.

    "content": "Hello, my name is Brett Pexa and I am a doctoral student in the Human Movement Science Curriculum at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The research team I am working with consists of Dr. Eric Ryan, Dr. Joe Myers, Dr. Tony Hackney, and Dr. David Berkoff. We are reaching out to you in hopes that you can help us recruit youth baseball players in the area to participate in a research study entitled “Non-invasive Assessment of Overuse Injury Mechanisms in the Adolescent Athlete.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are looking for healthy baseball players between the ages of 13 – 18. To qualify for this study, your son must not be injured or have pain or discomfort that has limited his baseball participation for the last 3 months. Your son can have no previous shoulder or elbow surgery in the past year, and he must be able to pitch the age recommended amount of pitches based on USA Baseball’s Pitch Smart guidelines. The purpose of this research study is to determine if ultrasound imaging of the infraspinatus, a shoulder muscle, can show how muscles recover following a bout of baseball pitching.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs a participant, you and your son will be required to sign an informed consent document stating you understand all of the procedures and rights as a research subject, and to fill out questionnaires regarding your baseball participation, injuries, and training. The study includes 4 testing visits over the course of 6 days. Your first visit will involve filling out the paperwork and performing the baseline assessment which will consist of a finger stick blood draw, shoulder range of motion and strength measures, and an ultrasound image of your infraspinatus, a muscle critical to baseball pitching. These images are taken with an ultrasound machine. Diagnostic ultrasound creates an image using sound waves, so no radiation or damaging imaging will be used with this study.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFollowing the baseline testing, your son will immediately pitch an age prescribed amount of pitches based on USA Baseball’s Pitch Smart guidelines. Once the pitch count is reached, the same testing procedures will be performed again. Your son will be asked to return on day 1, day 3, and day 5 following their bout of pitching, where the exact same assessments will be performed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nParticipants can receive up to $100 dollars in compensation. If you are interested or have questions, please contact Brett Pexa by phone or email.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBrett Pexa\r\n\r\n919-843-2014\r\n\r\npexa@live.unc.edu\r\n\r\n\r\nIRB#: 16-2714\r\n\r\nDate Approved: 3/2/2017\r\n\r\nBiomedical",

    "content": "\r\nDear Carolina Community:\r\n\r\nWelcome back to campus. We hope everyone had a restful and relaxing break.\r\n\r\nAs we begin 2018, we will continue to address many priorities and none is more important than protecting the safety of our campus community. The issue of sexual harassment is on the minds of everyone, as we have watched thousands of women across the nation courageously come forward to tell their stories. The #MeToo movement has started a powerful and important dialogue in our nation and around the world, and it’s helping inspire a transformative and positive change in our society.\r\n\r\nAnd we want to make sure our campus isn’t just a part of the conversation, but doing all we can to engage and create positive change right here. This is more than a movement; it’s about creating a culture where all of us can feel free to pursue our passions and dreams without fear of harassment.\r\n\r\nWe are taking a fresh and critical look at policies and procedures across the University to make sure we are doing everything we can to create an inclusive and respectful culture at Carolina. When we learn about problems, we will take steps to address them and hold people accountable. We also are working to improve prevention measures, including evaluating and enhancing our training programs. Discrimination and harassment are counter to our University’s core values and must never be tolerated, and yet we know that these serious offenses may happen anywhere, including on our campus. If you have experienced sexual or gender-based harassment or any form of discrimination or you know someone who has, we urge you to contact the University’s office of Equal Opportunity and Compliance or report it online. For more information about our policies, programs and resources, please visit Safe at UNC.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank the hundreds of people on our campus who work every day to strengthen our culture and help ensure that all of us feel safe to teach, learn and carry out the important work we are here to do. Our University is at its very best when we treat one another with respect and uphold the values we share as a community. We should all expect and tolerate nothing less.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarol L. Folt\r\nChancellor\r\n\r\nRobert A. Blouin\r\nExecutive Vice Chancellor and Provost\r\n\r\nFelicia A.

Universities are not immune to the problems revealed in the #MeToo movement. In fact, stark power differentials, professorial autonomy, and the pressure and rewards of scholarly success add complexities to the usual workplace challenges of upholding personal and organizational integrity. What responsibility do colleagues have to create a culture of respect, fairness and freedom from retaliation or harassment?\r\n\r\n“Am I My Brother’s Keeper?” will be presented by Dr. Kim Strom-Gottfried, director, Ethics Education &amp; Policy Management, and Smith P. Theimann Distinguished Professor in the School of Social Work.\r\n\r\nAll faculty, staff and students are encouraged to participate in this critical discussion. Details are provided in the attached flyer.\r\n\r\nUpcoming 2018 Carolina Conversations discussion topics will include:\r\n\r\nFebruary: “Talking about UNC History”\r\n\r\nMarch: “Navigating Unlawful Harassment and Uncomfortable Situations in the Workplace”\r\n\r\nApril: “What Does it Mean to be a Public University?”\r\n\r\nDates for these monthly sessions will be announced in the near future.

We are interested in learning how couples discuss and overcome barriers to increasing physical activity. Research shows that becoming more active can help people manage joint pain and stiffness, in addition to having other health benefits.\r\n\r\nParticipants will attend a 2 ½ hour, one-time meeting that may help them make changes to lead a more physically active lifestyle. Couples can earn up to $150 for participating in the study.\r\n\r\nCouples will be asked to:\r\n\r\nParticipate in a videotaped conversation with their partner about physical activity\r\nComplete an activity based on the recorded conversation\r\nFill out brief questionnaires\r\nCouples will not be engaging in any physical activity during the session\r\nYou may be eligible to participate if you are…\r\n\r\nAn adult with osteoarthritis or joint symptoms, such as pain or stiffness, in your hips or knees\r\nAt least 40 years of age\r\nMarried to or living with your partner\r\nEnglish speaking\r\nAre doing less than 150 minutes of physical activity per week\r\nIn addition, both you and your partner must be willing to join the study and attend the study meeting together in Chapel Hill, NC.\r\n\r\nFor more information or to find out if you are eligible, please call our toll free number at (844) 966-7538.

Universities are not immune to the problems revealed in the #MeToo movement. In fact, stark power differentials, professorial autonomy, and the pressure and rewards of scholarly success add complexities to the usual workplace challenges of upholding personal and organizational integrity. What responsibility do colleagues have to create a culture of respect, fairness and freedom from retaliation or harassment?\r\n\r\n“Am I My Brother’s Keeper?” will be presented by Dr. Kim Strom-Gottfried, director, Ethics Education &amp; Policy Management, and Smith P. Theimann Distinguished Professor in the School of Social Work.\r\n\r\nAll faculty, staff and students are encouraged to participate in this critical discussion. Details are provided in the attached flyer.\r\n\r\nUpcoming 2018 Carolina Conversations discussion topics will include:\r\n\r\nFebruary: “Talking about UNC History”\r\n\r\nMarch: “Navigating Unlawful Harassment and Uncomfortable Situations in the Workplace”\r\n\r\nApril: “What Does it Mean to be a Public University?”\r\n\r\nDates for these monthly sessions will be announced in the near future. For more information about Carolina Conversations, please visit go.unc.edu/carolinaconversations.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\n\r\nG. Rumay Alexander\r\nChief Diversity Officer",

Universities are not immune to the problems revealed in the #MeToo movement. In fact, stark power differentials, professorial autonomy, and the pressure and rewards of scholarly success add complexities to the usual workplace challenges of upholding personal and organizational integrity. What responsibility do colleagues have to create a culture of respect, fairness and freedom from retaliation or harassment?\r\n\r\n“Am I My Brother’s Keeper?” will be presented by Dr. Kim Strom-Gottfried, director, Ethics Education &amp; Policy Management, and Smith P. Theimann Distinguished Professor in the School of Social Work.\r\n\r\nAll faculty, staff and students are encouraged to participate in this critical discussion. Details are provided in the attached flyer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2018 Carolina Conversations discussion topics will include:\r\n\r\nFebruary: “Talking about UNC History”\r\n\r\nMarch: “Navigating Unlawful Harassment and Uncomfortable Situations in the Workplace”\r\n\r\nApril: “What Does it Mean to be a Public University?”\r\n\r\nDates for these monthly sessions will be announced in the near future.

Critical areas such as hospital parking lots and travel lanes will be pre-treated. \r\n\r\nParking and Transportation will be blocking the top level of parking decks at 7 p.m. today. If there is any change to local/regional public transportation services, the S11 lot will be open and available for employees without parking permits. Any updates or impacts to parking and transportation services will be posted at https://move.unc.edu/news/weather/.\r\n\r\nThe adverse weather team will continue to monitor the conditions overnight and we will update you if the path of the storm shifts and any major impacts to campus are expected.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDerek Kemp\r\nAssociate Vice Chancellor for Campus Safety and Risk Management\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ",

    "content": "\r\nDate: January 3, 2018\r\n\r\nTo: Deans, Directors, and Department Chairs\r\n\r\nFrom: Terry Magnuson, Vice Chancellor for Research\r\n\r\nRe: Interim Director and Deputy Director Named for the UNC Highway Safety Research Center\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDear Colleagues,\r\n\r\nDaniel Carter began as interim director, and Caroline Mozingo as interim deputy director, of the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center (HSRC)on January 1, 2018, as former Director David Harkey, PhD, retired last month.\r\n\r\nDaniel Carter served as a senior research associate at the HSRC. He joined the center in 2004 and uses his civil engineering background to address highway safety from the standpoint of infrastructure improvements. His research experience includes the areas of roadway and safety data, countermeasure evaluation and pedestrian safety.\r\n\r\nCaroline Mozingo served in her current role as the senior manager of communications, education and outreach for HSRC in January 2012. She leads the center’s internal and external communications, strategic development and education efforts, and supports individual project communications needs. Previously, Caroline served as the communications and marketing manager for the National Center for Safe Routes to School, which is housed within HSRC.\r\n\r\nCarter and Mozingo will be responsible for leading the center’s research programs, innovative approaches, and translation of research knowledge into practical interventions. HSRC manages the Collaborative Sciences Center for Road Safety, one of the U.S. Department of Transportation's five national University Transportation Centers. It is also home to several other major initiatives, including the Highway Safety Information System described above, Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center, Road Safety Academy, and Buckle Up NC, all of which aim to translate research into practice.\r\n\r\nThanks to HSRC — the only transportation center in the country focused solely on highway safety — being on the road today is much safer than it was 50 years ago when the center was founded. Dedicated to the promotion of the multidisciplinary interest in highway safety, HSRC has made a special effort to share expertise and research with communities, students, researchers, and practitioners.\r\n\r\nCarter and Mozingo succeed David Harkey, who served as the director of HSRC since 2006, and retired from the university in December. In January, he assumed the role of president of both the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the Highway Loss Data Institute.\r\n\r\nWith over 30 years of experience in the field of transportation safety research, including the past 23 with HSRC, Harkey has managed more than 30 major research projects and authored over 70 articles and research reports for federal, state, and private sponsors. He currently serves as the principal investigator for the Federal Highway Administration's Highway Safety Information System. Managed out of HSRC, this system is the only national database capable of conducting comprehensive risk analysis by linking crash data with roadway inventory and traffic operations data.\r\n\r\nA search committee has been established and will be working to identify HSRC's next director. Until the committee identifies a permanent successor, please join me in supporting Daniel and Caroline in their new roles, and in congratulating David on his retirement and his many years of service to the university.",

He brings with him experience and institutional knowledge gained from 22 years of service with the University, nine of which have been as the associate director of auxiliary services and director of food and vending. As interim director of auxiliary services, Scott supported the University’s partnership with Barnes and Noble and completed a $3.8M store renovation and led the Carolina Managed Print team in completing the transition of multifunction devices to Xerox on campus, resulting in savings of more than $690,000 since initiating the deployment.\r\n\r\nIn his new role, Scott will continue to provide leadership and direction to more than 800 auxiliary services and contracted employees. His experience with business operations, retail management and design projects will serve to support his department in future initiatives.\r\n\r\nI wish to thank the search committee and others in the campus community who were involved in the selection process, and to give special thanks to Cheryl Stout for her role as chair of the search committee.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in congratulating Scott as the new director of auxiliary services.",

This is a reminder that during this time, Facilities Services will have limited staff resources on call. The following areas may be of interest to your department regarding service coverage during the break:\r\n\r\nHousekeeping and Building Services: Staff will be available on an on-call basis to handle emergencies that should arise. Response times may be lengthened due to this status. The on-call service period will begin Friday night, Dec. 22, at 10 p.m., and end Tuesday morning, Jan. 2.\r\n\r\nEnergy Management: The University will implement a Winter Holiday Energy Saving Initiative to reduce energy consumption and utility costs by lowering temperatures in unoccupied buildings. This cost-effective initiative resulted in savings of $123,000 during Winter Break 2016. It is asked that you turn off all lights and unnecessary equipment and close all windows and fume hood sashes before leaving campus. The Initiative will begin Friday night, Dec. 22, at 10 p.m., and end Monday night, Jan. 1, at 10 p.m.\r\n\r\nExceptions to the Energy Saving Initiative: Research labs, animal facilities and designated health care facilities that are critical to the University’s mission are not included in this initiative. Other building occupants who submitted Exemption Requests by the Nov. 28 deadline have been notified of approved exemptions. However, even in these facilities the Housekeeping and Building Services on-call service period will be in effect.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your support and look forward to a successful Energy Saving Initiative over Winter Break 2017. For questions or concerns, contact Energy Management at save-energy@unc.edu.\r\n\r\n ",

Specific categories are shown below. A flow chart has been provided on the Provost’s website to help you identify the best award for the deserving teacher\r\n\r\nBoard of Governors' Award for Excellence in Teaching, given to a tenured faculty member on each campus for excellent and exceptional teaching at the undergraduate level over a sustained period of time (e.g., most of a career).\r\nDistinguished Teaching Awards for Post-Baccalaureate Instruction (4 awards), given to faculty members for exceptional teaching of graduate students, inside and outside of the classroom.\r\nAwards to Faculty for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching: Five Tanner Awards, one Friday Award and one Sitterson Award, given to full-time faculty members\r\nTanner Awards to Graduate Teaching Assistants (5 awards), given to graduate teaching assistants for excellence in undergraduate teaching.\r\nMentor Award for Lifetime Achievement, acknowledging lifetime contributions to teaching, learning and mentoring beyond the classroom. It is not limited to traditional faculty. Nominations for this award should focus on the candidate's long-term impact on students.\r\nChapman Family Teaching Awards: Three or four Chapman Family Awards are given to full-time faculty members for excellence in undergraduate teaching.\r\n\r\n Details of each of these awards can be found at http://provost.unc.edu/teaching-awards\r\n\r\n\r\n Please read the award requirements carefully to determine eligibility and provide comments in the nomination that will help the committee understand why your nominee is the best candidate for the award.\r\n\r\n Specific examples of particular ways in which the nominee has made a difference are especially effective.  The comments will become part of the nominee's departmental personnel file.  A nomination letter or statement must be included or the submission is invalid and will not be considered. A guidance document can be found on the Provost’s website to help construct an effective nomination letter.\r\n\r\n Nominations are accepted year round, but there are deadlines to observe.\r\n\r\n October 1 is the deadline for nominations for the awards to be announced in spring 2019.  (This allows time for the committee to review the nominees, collect additional information about their teaching and recommend winners to the Chancellor.)  The 2018 winners will be announced soon by the Chancellor and Provost soon.\r\n\r\n Please submit all nominations online at\r\n\r\nhttp://provost.unc.edu/teaching-awards\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your help in recognizing excellent teaching at Carolina, and congratulations to all students graduating this Sunday.  Well done!",

Wayne will be leaving his position in early 2018.\r\n\r\nWayne has been ombuds since coming to Carolina in 2005 when he worked to establish the University Ombuds Office. Since that time, he has built a nationally renowned program based on the principles of confidentiality, neutrality, informality and independence. During his 12-year tenure, Wayne has assisted thousands of students, faculty and staff and provided advice to senior leadership.\r\n\r\nWayne’s many contributions have extended beyond the campus. He developed and briefly led the ombuds program for the Town of Chapel Hill and has continued as a consultant to the program. He also took on leadership and teaching responsibilities for the International Ombuds Association, and ombuds from around the world have turned to Wayne for counsel and best practices.\r\n\r\nI am excited for Wayne and his opportunity to pursue this global opportunity. The Ombuds Office will continue to be staffed by Laurie Mesibov and Victoria Dowd, both of whom have worked side by side with Wayne since 2005. I am confident that we can build on the great work Wayne has done and will attract an outstanding successor for this important position. I will announce plans to launch a national search in the new year to identify the best candidates for the role of ombuds.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in thanking Wayne for his years of successful leadership as University ombuds. He has been an integral member of this campus and a valued colleague. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarol L. Folt\r\nChancellor",

He will leave Carolina in early February to start his new job.\r\n\r\nMatt has served as our chief finance and business officer since 2014 and has been an integral part of my senior leadership team. Matt has helped us reimagine the way the University conducts business and has worked to streamline our operations, as we have become a more complex and layered University.\r\n\r\nDuring Matt's tenure, we launched the Three Zeros initiative—a bold goal to reduce our environmental footprint through net zero water usage, zero waste to landfills and net zero greenhouse gas emissions.  He oversaw the transition of our Student Stores operation into modern retail space that is generating millions of dollars for student aid. Matt has also worked with the campus master planning team to ensure that the physical plans for campus are fully aligned with the priorities of our strategic framework.\r\n\r\nMatt has built a talented leadership team within Finance and Administration that will continue operating at the highest levels.  Provost Bob Blouin will lead a search for Matt’s successor and will announce his plans in the coming weeks. \r\n\r\nPlease join me in thanking Matt for his leadership during the last three years and for all he has done for Carolina.

    "content": "\r\nDear Students, Faculty and Staff:\r\n\r\nEach year, hundreds of people in the Carolina community travel internationally for important academic, research and outreach opportunities. We also travel abroad for personal reasons. In all cases, we would like to remind you of University requirements and resources that can help inform your plans for safe and productive international travel.\r\n\r\nUNC Global Travel Registry \r\n(http://globaltravel.unc.edu)\r\n\r\nAnyone traveling internationally in affiliation with the University must register the trip in the University's Global Travel Registry. The Global Travel Registry is a secure database with itineraries and contact information for students, faculty, and staff traveling abroad. The information in this database assists us in reaching travelers in case of urgent health or safety concerns. Students enrolled in travel programs through the Office of Study Abroad website or through their professional school administrator are automatically enrolled in the registry. For more information, please see https://global.unc.edu/travel-info/global-travel-registry or contact Andrew Hunt in the Office of the Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost at 919.962.3622 or andrew.hunt@unc.edu.\r\n\r\nInsurance Coverage Abroad \r\nhttp://global.unc.edu/travel-info/travel-insurance-and-risk-management\r\n\r\nAnyone traveling internationally in affiliation with the University must also enroll in the international health, evacuation, and repatriation insurance program established by General Administration and administered by GeoBlue. To enroll, please contact Janet Hoernke in Risk Management Services at 919.962.6681 or janet_hoernke@unc.edu. Students participating in programs through the Office of Study Abroad website or through their professional school administrator are pre-enrolled for coverage.

This research initiative of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health is dedicated to learning more about early child brain development. The BCP will provide an unprecedented view of how a healthy human brain develops and works.\r\n\r\nInclusion Criteria\r\n\r\nBirth at gestational age 37-42 weeks\r\nNormal birth weight\r\nAbsence of any major pregnancy and delivery complications\r\nWhat does this research study involve?\r\n\r\nYour child will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of his/her brain completed at different times in his/her development. These scans will be completed at UNC’s Marsico Hall. During this visit, behavioral assessments will be completed and saliva samples will be obtained. You will also be asked to provide history about you and your child’s medical history, and you will complete questionnaires about your child’s behavior.\r\n\r\nScans will be performed while your child is asleep or awake.  No medication or sedation will be used.\r\n\r\nWill I be paid for participating?\r\n\r\nYou will receive $90 for each visit, and parking will be provided at no cost.\r\n\r\nAre there any risks?\r\n\r\nMRI is a safe and non-invasive way of answering questions about the structural and functional organization of the brain as it develops. It has no known risks and does not use radiation or x-ray.\r\n\r\nWhy participate in this research study?\r\n\r\nYou and your child’s participation in this research study will help us learn more about children’s mental, emotional and behavioral development. It may also help us understand the possible causes of learning disabilities and neurodevelopmental disorders.\r\n\r\nHow can I learn more about joining this research study?\r\n\r\nPlease contact Jordan Jimenez at jordan_jimenez@med.unc.edu or call 919-843-4640 for more information.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis study titled \"Baby Connectome Project\" has been approved by the UNC Biomedical Institutional Review Board (IRB)- study #16-1943, approved 11/03/2017.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ",

    "content": "Dear Colleagues,\r\n\r\nI write to inform you that Steve Matson has announced plans to step down as Dean of the Graduate School at UNC-Chapel Hill after a decade of distinguished service in this leadership role.  Steve will return to the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences, Department of Biology, after his successor is in place. Steve joined the Carolina faculty in 1983 and became Dean of the Graduate School on July 1, 2008.  He is widely respected for his award-winning teaching, mentoring and research in the field of genetics and molecular biology. \r\n\r\nAs Dean of the Graduate School, he has advanced the University’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, to access and affordability, to excellence in academics, and to student success across all dimensions of the student experience for UNC’s 11,000 graduate and professional students.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of his tenure, he understood that graduate education was changing -- from primarily preparing the next generation of academics to preparing the next generation of academics and business, non-profit and civic leaders.  Under his leadership, the Graduate School developed a number of professional development programs to address this need in graduate education.  Based on the results of an extensive survey of our graduate students, the Graduate School developed the Graduate School Professional Development program, a collection of workshops and courses focused on developing competencies in communication, academic development, leadership, professionalism and career development.\r\n\r\nAlso during Steve’s tenure, UNC launched the Professional Science Master’s degrees, designed to meet the needs of today’s professionals who want to expand their technical and business knowledge and apply it to emerging professional fields within science and health.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, through a private gift, the Graduate School established a summer fellowship program for students in academic fields where summer support is limited.  The Summer Research Fellowship Program frees students from teaching and other work responsibilities so they can progress in their research and move more quickly toward degree completion.\r\n\r\nAnd early this semester, the Graduate School launched a graduate certificate in business fundamentals – communications, project management, leadership and financial accounting, reflecting student interest and the needs of the workplace.\r\n\r\nSteve also has been a leader in graduate education at the state and national levels.  He was elected to the Board of Directors of the Council of Graduate Schools in 2012 for a 4-year term.  He served as Chair of its Finance and Audit Committee in 2014-15.  He currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Graduate Records Exam (Chair, 2016-17) and on the Board of Directors for the TOEFL Exam.  He has been President-elect (2015-16) and President (2016-17) of the North Carolina Council of Graduate Schools.\r\n\r\nWe thank Steve for his leadership as the Graduate School has responded to the changes in graduate education and career prospects for master’s and doctoral students.  His vision and commitment have positioned the Graduate School well for years to come.  Please join me in thanking Steve for his service and extend best wishes as he returns to teaching and research.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBob Blouin\r\n\r\nExecutive Vice Chancellor and Provost",

    "content": "Subject: Early Development and Sleep Research Study\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nThe Frohlich Lab, a leader in brain network dynamics at UNC, has an exciting research study that your infant/toddler between the ages of 12-30 months can participate in with just 2 short sessions.\r\n\r\n In this research study, we are examining sleep characteristics in infants/toddlers that may have:\r\n\r\n-Language delays (i.e., no words at 18 months, limited vocalizations at 12 months)\r\n\r\n-Delays in social communication or play                   \r\n\r\n-Autism or who are at-risk for autism (have a sibling with autism). \r\n\r\nChildren develop and change rapidly during infancy and toddlerhood. We know that sleep is a critical aspect of health and brain development. However, little has been done to document patterns of sleep in young children or examine how brain activity during sleep may differ in children with delays and children with autism.\r\n\r\n~You may be eligible if:\r\n\r\nYour family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months with language delays (i.e., no words at 18 months, limited vocalizations at 12 months)\r\n. Your family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months with delays in social communication or play\r\n\r\n.  Your family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months with an autism spectrum disorder.\r\n\r\nYour family has an infant/toddler 12-30 months who has an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder.\r\n \r\n\r\n~We schedule the two visits at your convenience and you will be with your child at all times. Each visit will take about 2- 2 ½ hours. The types of activities involved:\r\n\r\n. A visit to your home at your convenience: Infant developmental assessments\r\n\r\n. A visit to the nap room: Non-invasive recording (brain rhythms) during a midday nap. Your child will be playing with a variety of toys and taking a nap. This location offers free parking. \r\n\r\nWe will compensate you $75 for your time. For more information, or to see if your child is eligible, please call Jessica Page at 919-445-0227 or email jessica.page@unc.edu or EDS@med.unc.edu.  You can find out more on our website at http://www.frohlichlab.org/.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your participation!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frohlich Lab\r\n                        This study was approved by the UNC biomedical IRB on 1/29/17 (IRB # 15-1829)",

    "content": "Dear Colleagues,\r\n\r\nI write to inform you that Steve Matson has announced plans to step down as Dean of the Graduate School at UNC-Chapel Hill after a decade of distinguished service in this leadership role.  Steve will return to the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences, Department of Biology, after his successor is in place. Steve joined the Carolina faculty in 1983 and became Dean of the Graduate School on July 1, 2008.  He is widely respected for his award-winning teaching, mentoring and research in the field of genetics and molecular biology. \r\n\r\nAs Dean of the Graduate School, he has advanced the University’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, to access and affordability, to excellence in academics, and to student success across all dimensions of the student experience for UNC’s 11,000 graduate and professional students.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of his tenure, he understood that graduate education was changing -- from primarily preparing the next generation of academics to preparing the next generation of academics and business, non-profit and civic leaders.  Under his leadership, the Graduate School developed a number of professional development programs to address this need in graduate education.  Based on the results of an extensive survey of our graduate students, the Graduate School developed the Graduate School Professional Development program, a collection of workshops and courses focused on developing competencies in communication, academic development, leadership, professionalism and career development.\r\n\r\nAlso during Steve’s tenure, UNC launched the Professional Science Master’s degrees, designed to meet the needs of today’s professionals who want to expand their technical and business knowledge and apply it to emerging professional fields within science and health.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, through a private gift, the Graduate School established a summer fellowship program for students in academic fields where summer support is limited.  The Summer Research Fellowship Program frees students from teaching and other work responsibilities so they can progress in their research and move more quickly toward degree completion.\r\n\r\nAnd early this semester, the Graduate School launched a graduate certificate in business fundamentals – communications, project management, leadership and financial accounting, reflecting student interest and the needs of the workplace.\r\n\r\nSteve also has been a leader in graduate education at the state and national levels.  He was elected to the Board of Directors of the Council of Graduate Schools in 2012 for a 4-year term.  He served as Chair of its Finance and Audit Committee in 2014-15.  He currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Graduate Records Exam (Chair, 2016-17) and on the Board of Directors for the TOEFL Exam.  He has been President-elect (2015-16) and President (2016-17) of the North Carolina Council of Graduate Schools.\r\n\r\nWe thank Steve for his leadership as the Graduate School has responded to the changes in graduate education and career prospects for master’s and doctoral students.  His vision and commitment have positioned the Graduate School well for years to come.  Please join me in thanking Steve for his service and extend best wishes as he returns to teaching and research.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBob Blouin\r\n\r\nExecutive Vice Chancellor and Provost",

The Red Cross is making the donation process even smoother this year; walk-ups will have a designated blood donation pod, and donors can use Rapid Pass to save time giving blood. Blood and platelet donors can save time at their next donation by using RapidPass to complete their pre-donation reading and health history questionnaire online, on the day of their donation, from a computer or mobile device. Try RapidPass to save up to 15 minutes off donation time. Learn more or complete a RapidPass at redcrossblood.org/RapidPass.\r\n\r\nSchedule an appointment\r\n\r\nSpeak with a Red Cross representative to schedule an appointment by calling 1-800-RED CROSS. Sign up online at redcrossblood.org with the sponsor code UNC or use the Red Cross Blood Donor App. For eligibility requirements, details or to volunteer, visit Carolina Blood Drive.\r\n\r\nFree parking is available in Cobb Deck off Country Club Road, and all presenting donors will receive a free, customized Holiday Carolina Blood Drive Red Cross T-shirt.\r\n\r\nStudents, consider taking a study break to donate blood - snacks will be provided. For UNC-Chapel Hill employees, time spent donating and volunteering is considered work time with permission from a supervisor.\r\n\r\nJust one donation can help save three lives. Please join us and give blood at the Holiday Carolina Blood Drive!",

As a federal contractor, the University is required to annually report aggregate information to the federal government. Having this information also helps the University better serve all the members of our community, as we strive to provide a working, learning and living environment that is welcoming and inclusive.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Equal Opportunity and Compliance Office is asking that you voluntarily self-identify in these three areas. The reporting processes are quick and easy, and all information you provide will be kept confidential and will be used only by the Equal Opportunity and Compliance Office for reporting purposes, consistent with federal regulations. Updates should be made by December 11 so we can gather the data before the end of the calendar year.\r\n\r\nSign into ConnectCarolina (http://connectcarolina.unc.edu) with your UNC Onyen and password. Under the Self Service heading, you will see options to self-identify race/ethnicity, veteran status and disability status.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or feedback, or need assistance, contact the Equal Opportunity and Compliance Office at eoc@unc.edu or 919-966-3576. Further, if you believe that you require an accommodation based on your status as an individual with a disability or a disabled veteran, you may also contact EOC for assistance. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your participation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrandon Washington\r\nDirector of Equal Opportunity and Compliance\r\n\r\n ",

During this time, Facilities Services will have limited staff resources on call. The following areas may be of interest to your department regarding service coverage during the break:\r\n\r\nHousekeeping and Building Services: Staff will be available on an on-call basis to handle emergencies that should arise. Response times may be lengthened due to this status. The on-call service period will begin Friday night, Dec. 22, at 10 p.m., and end Tuesday morning, Jan. 2.\r\n\r\nEnergy Management: The University will implement a Winter Holiday Energy Saving Initiative to reduce energy consumption and utility costs by lowering temperatures in unoccupied buildings. This cost-effective initiative resulted in savings of $123,000 during Winter Break 2016. It is asked that you turn off all lights and unnecessary equipment and close all windows and fume hood sashes before leaving campus. The Initiative will begin Friday night, Dec. 22, at 10 p.m., and end Monday night, Jan. 1, at 10 p.m.\r\n           Exceptions to the Energy Saving Initiative: Research labs, animal facilities and designated health care facilities that are critical to the University’s mission are not included in this energy saving initiative. However, even in these facilities the Housekeeping and Building Services on-call service period will be in effect.\r\n\r\nIf you have a special need or event during the break that will require an exemption from the 2017 Winter Holiday Energy Saving Initiative or will require Housekeeping and/or Building Services staff, please submit an Exemption Request by 5 p.m. Nov. 28, 2017.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit exemption requests via the Facilities Services Service Request portal or directly to Facilities Services personnel. Building occupants will be notified of approved exemptions by 5 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2017.\r\n\r\nFor questions or concerns, contact Energy Management at save-energy@unc.edu.\r\n\r\nThank you for supporting this important initiative.\r\n\r\n ",

    "content": "The UNC Neuromuscular Research Lab is seeking paid volunteers for a research study on anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and reconstruction surgery. Individuals who have injured their ACLs are at a heightened risk of developing knee osteoarthritis, partly because of weakness and dysfunction in the quadriceps muscle. Current rehabilitation approaches are often not effective for restoring quadriceps function due to a neuromuscular factor called arthrogenic muscle inhibition and the fact that the best ways to treat it are unclear.\r\n\r\n Applying vibration to a muscle improves its function and may be an effective way to treat quadriceps dysfunction following ACL injury and reconstruction. The purposes of this research study are to determine if two types of vibration (whole body vibration and local muscle vibration) improve quadriceps muscle function, proprioception (sensation of how your joints are positioned), and walking gait biomechanics in individuals with ACL injuries.\r\n\r\n If you decide to participate, you will be asked to report to the Neuromuscular Research Laboratory on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus for 3 testing sessions. One session will last approximately 45 minutes while the other two will last about an hour and a half. During these testing sessions you will be asked to complete 3 separate tests: 1) quadriceps muscle function, 2) walking gait biomechanics, and 3) sensory function/proprioception. You will then receive an intervention (whole body vibration, local muscle vibration, or control/no vibration) designed to improve these characteristics, and these tests will be repeated. You will also be asked to complete 3 online surveys regarding the details of your initial injury and surgery, your level of physical activity, and any symptoms you currently experience.\r\n\r\n There are some risks associated with participating in this research study, but they are not greater than the risks associated with normal physical activity/exercise.\r\n\r\n To be eligible to participate, you must meet the following inclusion criteria:\r\n\r\nAge 18 – 35 years\r\nHistory of ACL injury and reconstruction in only 1 of your legs within the last 6 months to 5 years\r\nNo history of ACL graft rupture or revision surgery\r\nNo history of injury to either leg within the last 6 months other than ACL injury and reconstruction surgery\r\nNo history of neurological disorder such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or cerebral palsy\r\nCleared by a physician for return to physical activity, and currently physically active, participating in at least 20 minutes of physical activity 3x per week\r\nNot currently pregnant\r\n Your total participation in the study will last approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes, and you will receive $125 for participating.\r\n\r\n If you meet these inclusion criteria and are interested in participating, please contact Chris Johnston at cdjohnst@email.unc.edu.\r\n\r\n This study was approved by the UNC-CH Biomedical Institutional Review Board on 5/18/2015 (IRB# 15-0838). ",

    "content": "\r\nFaculty and administrators at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University are invited to nominate outstanding scholars, artists, or practitioners for the Nannerl Keohane Distinguished Visiting Professorship. Nominations are welcome for academic years 2018-19 and 2019-20.  Nominations are due by January 31, 2018. \r\n\r\nThe Keohane Professorship recognizes the remarkable contributions of Dr. Nannerl Keohane during her term as President of Duke University, and the unprecedented level of collaboration she and UNC Chancellor James Moeser created between these two great institutions.  The award was created in 2004 by Chancellor Moeser and was funded by Carolina graduate Julian Robertson and his late wife, Josie, of New York (parents of Spencer Robertson, Duke ’98, and Alex Robertson, UNC ’01) and the William R. Kenan, Jr. Charitable Trust.  \r\n\r\nInitially, proposals were accepted on any topic; however, in 2016, the professorship directed its focus on proposals that allow the two universities to work together to extend their capacity in specific areas.  In 2016-17 and 2017-18, areas of focus were data science; entrepreneurship and innovation; and the arts.  For 2018-19 and 2019-20, the focus areas will be as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Environment: Energy, Water, and Land Resources\r\nCitizenship and Opportunity in the Context of Race, Religion, and Culture\r\nOptimizing Well-being through Precision and Population Health Care\r\nUsing Data Science to Solve Complex Problems\r\nThese focus areas correspond with the strategic priorities as expressed in Duke’s Collaboratories initiative and with UNC’s Creativity Hubs.  Nominations that magnify the work of the Collaboratories and Creativity Hubs will be given preference.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGoals of the Professorship \r\n\r\nPromote inter-institutional collaboration and the enhancement of intellectual life at both universities by strengthening established collaborations or encouraging new ones;\r\nContribute to the teaching missions of both UNC and Duke—in particular to the undergraduate curriculum—through a self-standing course or the co-teaching of one or more courses, or through a carefully planned series of guest appearances in a number of courses;\r\nShare the work of the Visiting Professor widely through public lectures or performances.\r\n \r\n\r\nStructure, Activities, and Funding\r\n\r\nRecipients typically spend a semester or the equivalent of a semester in the program; however, proposals will be accepted for residencies of varying lengths based upon the schedule of the nominee and the collaborations proposed.  Past recipients have catalyzed cross-campus undergraduate and graduate programs, conducted joint projects with Carolina and Duke research centers, taught joint Carolina and Duke courses, and delivered major public addresses.\r\n\r\nThe recipient is entitled to a payment of $60,000 US dollars (before taxes) for a full semester residency or $30,000 for a half semester residency (or its equivalent). Fringe benefits are also provided at a rate of 10% of the stipend payment. The recipient may request reimbursement for a maximum amount of $20,000 US dollars ($10,000 for a half semester residency) for costs associated with the Professorship, which could include housing, travel (including dependents), research, and other related expenses. Stipend and expense levels for recipients visiting for other periods of time may be negotiated; however, each professorship must involve a period of time sufficient to allow the goals of the professorship to be met.  For reimbursement, the award recipient must provide the necessary documentation and receipts of the expenses within 30 days of the conclusion of the Professorship. The award is contingent on the ability of the recipient to receive the funds.  International recipients are responsible for obtaining the necessary visa in order to receive payment.  Sponsoring departments also will receive $5,000 per visitor for expenses associated with public lectures or performances.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nResponsibilities of the nominating units\r\n\r\nThe Department(s) hosting the recipient is responsible for all other costs related to instruction, office, and clerical support (copying, space, office phone, etc.). All arrangements should be handled by the host Department(s). Such arrangements could include (though are not limited to) helping the recipient access resources such as IT support, University libraries, equipment, campus parking, as well as providing any appropriate advice on housing and living in the local community.  For international recipients, the Department(s) hosting the recipient must assure that the visa process is appropriately handled by the recipient.  The nominating Department at UNC-CH will be responsible for making all expense reimbursements and payroll arrangements for the recipient during the term of the professorship.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNomination Process\r\n\r\nEach nomination must describe how the professorship will achieve the three main goals of the professorship as listed above and must state its relationship to one of the four focus areas specified for 2018-2020.  Each nomination must be made jointly by faculty members and/or administrators from both institutions, and must be accompanied by the signatures of the relevant Department Chairs or other administrators at both institutions.\r\n\r\nNomination letters should be as specific as possible and include descriptions of the following: \r\n\r\nhow the nominee will advance inter-institutional collaboration and intellectual life at Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill in the specified area of focus;\r\nthe nominee’s qualifications, including how s/he has demonstrated the ability to work across departmental or institutional boundaries;\r\nprogrammatic benefits that would arise from the professorship and a plan for assessment of impact;\r\nnew initiatives that will arise from the professorship and serve both UNC and Duke.\r\nPlease also include the nominee’s CV.\r\n\r\nNominations must be received no later than Friday, January 31, 2018 and should be sent electronically to susan.booth@duke.edu.   Questions about the Professorship may be addressed to Carol Tresolini (carol_tresolini@unc.edu) or Noah Pickus (noah.pickus@duke.edu), Co-Chairs of the Nannerl Keohane Distinguished Visiting Professorship Joint Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\nThe joint advisory committee shall make its recommendations to the Provosts of each institution in February 2018, and the two Provosts shall make the final selection.  We anticipate awarding a total of six professorships during the two-year period spanning academic years 2018-19 and 2019-20.",

    "content": "On Sept. 7, 2017, the State Human Resources Commission approved revisions to the SHRA “Disciplinary Action Policy” (formerly, “Disciplinary Action, Suspension and Dismissal Policy”).\r\n\r\nReason for Policy Change\r\n\r\nAlthough these revisions do not significantly change current policy and practice, there is a significant restructuring of the policy. Some aspects of the disciplinary process that were undefined in the former policy have been articulated in the new policy to foster greater consistency of practice. Because practices at individual institutions may have evolved independently over time within the parameters of the former policy, this policy revision may require some modifications to current institutional procedures. \r\n\r\nTo ensure consistency with the Disciplinary Action Policy, revision details from the Office of State Human Resources are outlined below:\r\n\r\n1. Policy Name Change\r\n\r\nDisciplinary Action Policy (formerly, “Disciplinary Action, Suspension and Dismissal Policy”).\r\n\r\n2. Documented Counseling Session\r\n\r\nThe revised policy expects a documented counseling session to occur prior to issuing a written warning for unsatisfactory job performance, unless Human Resources allows for an exception due to the nature of the incident(s).\r\n\r\n3. Advance Notice to Attend a Pre-Disciplinary Conference\r\n\r\nThe revised policy sets a minimum 24 hours advance written notice to an employee prior to holding the pre-disciplinary conference. This was undefined in the former policy.\r\n\r\n4. Lifespan of a Disciplinary Action\r\n\r\nWritten warnings, suspensions, and demotions remain active for 18 months, and this active period extends if another disciplinary action is issued in that timeframe. The revised policy also sets the maximum extended period up to an additional 18 months. This means that no individual action will be active longer than a total of 36 months.\r\n\r\nThe lifespan of active actions issued prior to Nov. 1, 2017, remain active as provided by the policy in place prior to Nov. 1, 2017.\r\n\r\n5. Allowed Participants in the Pre-Disciplinary Conference\r\n\r\nThe supervisor or other person chosen by agency management to conduct the conference; that person will be a representative from Employee &amp; Management Relations, Office of Human Resources.  \r\nA management representative must be present at management’s discretion; that person may be the supervisor or an alternate management representative.  \r\nThe employee;\r\nUniversity procedures may provide for one additional neutral party, if agreed upon by the employee and management.\r\nIf the person conducting the conference chooses, security may be present.\r\nNo other parties may be present at the PDC.\r\n6. Employee Assistance Program (EAP)\r\n\r\nPlease note that references to the Employee Assistance Program and related fitness for duty procedures apply to the agency’s separate EAP program and not to the University’s EAP programs.",

The winning research teams are pursuing solutions to two of the world’s most pressing issues: the obesity epidemic and the global clean water shortage.\r\n\r\nThe Creativity Hubs initiative was developed to support the Carolina Blueprint for Next strategic framework, and is a platform on which research teams are assembled from diverse disciplines to tackle major societal challenges.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the strengths of Carolina’s schools of medical and health sciences, its affiliated research centers and institutes, and its prowess in big data management, the Heterogeneity in Obesity Creativity Hub, led by Penny Gordon-Larsen, professor of nutrition in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health,  will take a novel approach to assess the underlying causes of obesity, tapping information that has not been traditionally studied to unlock new, targeted ways to treat the disease.\r\n\r\nBy developing an automated tool to rapidly analyze and integrate large data sets, the team will seek answers to why individuals with the same diet experience weight gain and loss differently. Their research is expected to lead to more personalized treatments that take into account the wide range of factors — from diet, to social influences, to genetics — that contribute to weight gain and loss. \r\n\r\nAddressing a need that affects over 1.8 billion people worldwide, the Sustainable Access to Clean Water Creativity Hub, led by Theo Dingemans, professor of applied physical science in the College of Arts and Sciences, will pursue development of an innovative, affordable membrane-based water purification solution that can safely remove a broad range of water contaminants.\r\n\r\nThe project team is comprised of polymer chemists, computational modelers, and engineers from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences’ Applied Physical Sciences and Mathematics departments and the Gillings School of Global Public Health. Building on existing graphene and graphene oxide membrane technologies that have shown promise as water purifiers, the team will seek to develop new filters that make water purification more energy-efficient and to lay a foundation for large-scale, affordable membrane production.\r\n\r\nThe Creativity Hubs initiative was developed by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research to foster fluid, cross-disciplinary research, to establish campus networks that nurture research innovation and risk-taking, and to promote a pervasive culture that drives discovery and curiosity. The inaugural winners of the Creativity Hubs awards were selected from proposals involving 194 UNC researchers from 35 departments in 10 schools and the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. Each team will receive up to $250,000 toward the development of their proposals. Progress will be assessed after one year and the teams could be eligible for up to an additional $250,000 in funding.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the UNC Creativity Hubs initiative and the winning teams, please visit: research.unc.edu\/creativity-hubs.\r\n\r\n ",

    "content": "\r\nThe University of North Carolina System is committed to periodically reviewing its retirement programs to make sure they continue to help you meet your retirement and financial goals. Among the things considered are the range of investment options available through the plans, investment option performance and value, and the resources available to help you manage your account. \r\n\r\nAs a result of a recent review, the UNC System has decided to make the following changes to the investment lineup for both the UNC Optional Retirement Plan (ORP) and the UNC System 457(b) Plan effective May 7, 2018. \r\n\r\nPlease note these changes will not apply to the UNC System 403(b) Plan due to current federal regulations; however, the UNC System Office is contacting the Internal Revenue Service to determine if the new investment funds can be made available in the UNC System 403(b) Plan at a later date.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this email is to inform you of these changes and how you may be affected. You do not need to take any action.\r\n\r\nWHAT’S CHANGING\r\n\r\nThe UNC System will replace the 12 Vanguard Target Retirement Funds currently offered in the ORP and UNC System 457(b) Plan with Vanguard Target Retirement Trusts.\r\n\r\nThe Vanguard Target Retirement Funds currently offered in the plans are mutual funds. The new Vanguard Target Retirement Trusts are commingled trusts. Trusts operate like mutual funds but are available only to institutional investors, including you as a participant in the ORP and\/or UNC System 457(b) Plan.\r\n\r\nFunds and trusts often invest in the same underlying securities and have the same objectives. Because trusts are only offered to institutions that have more money to invest, they can achieve greater efficiency and charge lower expense ratios than mutual funds. This reduces the overall cost for you to invest in them. (See the chart below for the expense ratios of the current and new investment options.)\r\n\r\nThe new Vanguard Target Retirement Trusts will be available to all ORP and UNC System 457(b) Plan participants beginning May 7, 2018. For more information about the new trusts, click here or visit the Vanguard Target Retirement Trust website at https:\/\/retirementplans.vanguard.com\/ekit\/pmed\/trf\/index.html?&amp;opw&amp;UNC&amp;.\r\n\r\nPlease note that since the Vanguard Target Retirement Trusts are only available to institutional investors, you will not be able to monitor their investment returns through a service such as Morningstar. You will need to visit your investment carrier’s website for the latest information. You may also visit the Vanguard Target Retirement Trust website and select How to Choose One. Here you will find links to the Target Retirement Trust fact sheets. The fact sheets contain the latest investment information and are updated at the end of each month.\r\n\r\nIf you are currently investing in one of the Vanguard Target Retirement Funds, the chart below shows how the current investment options will map to the new investment options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpense ratio information as of March 27, 2018.\r\n\r\nWhat You Need to Do\r\nYou do not need to do anything. When the market closes on May 7, 2018, all existing balances in the Vanguard Target Retirement Funds will be automatically transferred to the Vanguard Retirement Trusts as indicated in the chart above. In addition, any future contributions will be invested in the new investment trust as shown above, unless you contact TIAA or Fidelity to change your contributions.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a confirmation statement from your retirement carrier.

    "content": "To:       Deans, Directors and Department Chairs\r\n\r\nFrom:   Dwayne Pinkney, CFO and Senior Associate Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration; Brian T. Smith, Assistant Vice Chancellor for Finance; Ken Pittman, Executive Director, Campus Health Services\r\n\r\nRe:       Graduate Student Health Insurance Program – Enrollment for 2018-19 and Other Issues\r\n\r\nIn August 2009, the UNC Board of Governors approved the implementation of a “hard waiver” student health insurance plan on all sixteen 4-year campuses beginning in fall 2010. The term “hard waiver” means any graduate or undergraduate student meeting three specific criteria (enrolled in a minimum of 6 credit hours if an undergraduate or 1 credit hour if a graduate student, degree-seeking, and eligible to pay the student health fee) is required to show evidence of an existing “creditable coverage” health insurance policy or purchase a creditable insurance policy OR enroll in the UNC system-wide plan.\r\n\r\nGraduate students enrolled in the Graduate Student Health Insurance Program (GSHIP), frequently referred to as the RA\/TA Health Insurance Plan, must submit an online waiver using their GSHIP insurance at  www.bcbsnc.com\/unc or they will be charged $1,311.50 each semester on their University account for the system wide Student Blue insurance plan available to all undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe UNC Chapel Hill GSHIP plan is a separate insurance plan from the system wide Student Blue insurance plan. Graduate students functioning as Research Assistants (RA), Teaching Assistants (TA), Fellows, or Trainees should continue to be enrolled in the GSHIP plan each semester through their academic program. RA\/TA’s should not enroll themselves in the system wide Student Blue insurance plan available to all undergraduates and graduate students.\r\n\r\nDue to ongoing state and federal regulatory changes in health care and the insurance marketplace, UNC General Administration has been reviewing all University sponsored health plans system-wide.  Effective with the 2014-2015 plan year, the RA\/TA Plan was no longer offered as an employer provided plan and enrollees do not have access to COBRA upon discontinuation of the plan.\r\n\r\nOther GSHIP plan benefits remain the same and require fewer out of pocket expenses than the system wide Student Blue insurance plan. The system wide Student Blue insurance plan cannot be substituted for the GSHIP plan.\r\n\r\nThe insurance program for graduate students is separate from insurance programs for Clinical Fellows, Postdoctoral Trainees, and Postdoctoral Research Associates. The purpose of this memorandum is to provide information regarding the 2018-19 enrollment process for the Graduate Student Health Insurance Program as well as other pertinent information. The 2018-19 policy year is from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019.\r\n\r\nFor the 2018-19 policy year the minimum prescribed compensation amount for services that a student must receive is $5,700.00. The premium cost per student for annual coverage during the current policy year under the program, provided through Blue Cross Blue Shield of NC, is $3994.92 ($332.91 per month). The Campus Health Fee is $200.08 per semester ($400.15 per academic year) for fiscal year 2018-19.\r\n\r\nPlease note the following:\r\n\r\nFor the 2018-19 policy year BCBS will not automatically waive graduate students that are enrolled in the GSHIP insurance. Students must complete an online waiver or be charged for the system wide Student Blue insurance plan.  The fall waiver deadline is September 10, 2018 and the spring waiver deadline is January 31, 2019.\r\n\r\nTo ensure students receive their GSHIP BCBS policy ID card prior to August 1st the department must enroll their RA\/TA’s into GSHIP with ample time to receive their cards.  Enrollment must be completed even for those students currently on the GSHIP plan. If enrollments are not received by BCBSNC prior to August 15, 2018, students will receive a HIPAA certificate from BCBSNC stating coverage terminated July 31, 2018.  If they feel they have received the letter in error, they will be directed to their academic program\/department for any questions concerning receipt of this letter.\r\n\r\nEffective August 1, 2015 retroactive enrollments or terminations exceeding 60 days will no longer be allowed for administrative errors.  Exceptions for extenuating circumstances (delays due to death, hospitalization, etc.) will only be considered.\r\n\r\nThe following policy, procedures, forms and manual (see links below) provide detailed information about the Graduate Student Health Insurance Plan. Please review all documents.\r\n\r\nPolicy 1112 – Graduate Student Health Insurance Program (GSHIP) - Eligibility Criteria and Other Provisions of the Health Insurance Plan (http:\/\/financepolicy.unc.edu\/1112 )\r\nProcedure 1112.1 – Verifying Student Eligibility for GSHIP (http:\/\/financepolicy.unc.edu\/1112_1 )\r\nForm - 1112.1.1f – Graduate Student Health Insurance Program Verification of Student Eligibility (https:\/\/financepolicy.unc.edu\/1112_1_1f )\r\nProcedure 1112.2 – Enrolling in the Graduate Student Health Insurance Program (GSHIP) (http:\/\/financepolicy.unc.edu\/1112_2 )\r\nProcedure 1112.3 – Paying Graduate Students (http:\/\/financepolicy.unc.edu\/1112_3)\r\nProcedure 1112.4 – Paying GSHIP Insurance Premium (http:\/\/financepolicy.unc.edu\/1112_4 )\r\n\r\nThe information in this memorandum is the result of extensive discussions among academic and administrative departments concerning appropriate procedures and practices for the Graduate Student Health Insurance Program. Your additional comments regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of the procedures and practices are most welcome as efforts to improve the program administration.\r\n\r\nPlease notify the following individuals regarding your questions or comments.

We are currently recruiting pregnant women and new mothers.\r\nDetails are below. Please share this message with friends and family. \r\n\r\nParticipants receive: \r\n- $200 per visit (potential total of $400) \r\n- Reimbursement for mileage and parking \r\n\r\nWho can participate in this study? To be in this study, your child must be exclusively breastfed (no formula, gripe water, or sugar water) until the first study visit. Babies cannot be in the study if they receive formula or antibiotics before the first study visit.\r\n\r\nWhat does this study involve? When your child is 2 weeks old he\/she will receive a MRI scan of the brain. We will also collect a small blood sample via heel prick and several samples of saliva (spit). When your child is 1 year old, we will observe how he\/she responds to new people and toys. He\/she will also receive a MRI scan at this visit. We will collect a small blood sample via heel prick and spit samples as before. We will also ask you to collect fecal (stool) samples from your child prior to both visits.\r\n\r\nWhy participate in this study? Research is designed to benefit society by gaining new knowledge. By participating you and your child may help us better understand and prevent psychiatric problems in future generations. The benefits to your child from being in this study may be the opportunity to have a thorough evaluation of his or her brain and early behavior.\r\n\r\nAre there any risks? There is no evidence that MRI scans have any harmful effects. MRIs do not use x-rays or radiation. Children are scanned during natural sleep. Heel pricks will be done by trained personnel with supplies designed to minimize discomfort.\r\nRemember:  this is a voluntary study, no medicine or sedation is involved, you will be compensated, and all information gathered is confidential.\r\n\r\nHow do I learn more about joining this study?  Call Jennifer Prater, study coordinator, at (919) 843-5902 or (866) 849-0541 (Toll Free), or send an email to jennifer_prater@med.unc.edu with your name, phone number and times that you can be reached. This is a confidential study: we will not share your email address with anyone outside of the study. \r\n\r\nThis research study is funded by the National Institute of Health.\r\n\r\nThe Early Brain Development Study and this message have received approval on May 1st, 2017 from the UNC Biomedical IRB, Study # 14-0932",

    "content": "Subject: Early Development and Sleep Research Study\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nThe Frohlich Lab, has an exciting research study that your infant\/toddler between the ages of 12-30 months can participate in with just 2 short sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this research study, we are examining sleep characteristics in infants\/toddlers that may have:\r\n\r\n\r\n-Language delays (i.e., no words at 18 months, limited vocalizations at 12 months)\r\n-Delays in social communication or play \r\n-Autism or who are at-risk for autism (have a sibling with autism). \r\n\r\n\r\nChildren develop and change rapidly during infancy and toddlerhood. We know that sleep is a critical aspect of health and brain development. However, little has been done to document patterns of sleep in young children or examine how brain activity during sleep may differ in children with delays and children with autism. \r\n\r\n\r\n~You may be eligible if:\r\n· Your family has an infant\/toddler 12-30 months with language delays (i.e., no words at 18 months, limited vocalizations at 12 months)\r\n. Your family has an infant\/toddler 12-30 months with delays in social communication or play\r\n. Your family has an infant\/toddler 12-30 months with an autism spectrum disorder.\r\n · Your family has an infant\/toddler 12-30 months who has an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder.\r\n\r\n~We schedule the two visits at your convenience and you will be with your child at all times. Each visit will take about 2- 2 ½ hours. The types of activities involved: \r\n. A visit to your home at your convenience: Infant developmental assessments \r\n. A visit to the nap room: Non-invasive recording (brain rhythms) during a midday nap. Your child will be playing with a variety of toys and taking a nap. This location offers free parking.\r\n\r\nWe will compensate you $75 for your time. For more information, or to see if your child is eligible, please call Jessica Page at 919-445-0227 or email jessica.page@unc.edu or EDS@med.unc.edu. You can find out more on our website at http:\/\/www.frohlichlab.org\/.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your participation!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frohlich Lab\r\n\r\n\r\nThis study was approved by the UNC biomedical IRB on 1\/16\/18 (IRB # 15-1829)",

Tan has served as chief of research strategy for the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR) since July of 2016.   \r\n\r\nAs associate vice chancellor for research, she promotes interdisciplinary integration, cultivating growth of the University’s global research reputation. Her responsibilities include working closely with leadership in University schools and the College, as well as pan-campus centers and institutes to design, facilitate collaboration and execute strategic, multidisciplinary initiatives such as the OVCR’s Creativity Hubs program. She also facilitates innovation and entrepreneurship by connecting the OVCR with leadership across UNC, and by promoting research partnerships with external public and private organizations.\r\n\r\nPrior to working with the OVCR, Tan served as director of industry alliances within the School of Medicine and program manager for the Carolina Center for Genome Sciences and the Department of Genetics.  In these roles she conducted capacity building activities to attract extramural funding as well as, built and developed partnerships and alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.  Her scientific background is in immunology, and she has made important scientific contributions to vaccine development, the understanding of how T cells populate the immune system, and how T cells maintain memory to respond to subsequent infections.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in welcoming and supporting Joyce in her new role.",

(No obligation to take the class if they come to the informational session).\r\n\r\nUNC now offers a mindful self-compassion class for adolescents, ages 14-18. Mindful Self-Compassion brings together the benefits of mindfulness and self-compassion:  Mindfulness teaches us to be present with difficult emotions, and self-compassion helps us to respond to these emotions with greater kindness and self-care.\r\n\r\nThrough developmentally appropriate activities and meditations, teens learn specific tools, which help them, navigate the emotional difficulties of this life stage with greater ease.  A preliminary research study on this program has demonstrated significant decreases in depression, anxiety, perceived stress and negative mood from before to after taking this course.\r\n\r\nClass Dates: Thursdays, April 26 through June 14, 2018\r\n\r\nInstructors: Kate Murphy and Laura Prochnow Phillips\r\n\r\nTime: 5:00-6:45PM\r\n\r\nLocation:UNC Center for Rehabilitation Care, 1807 Fordham Blvd., Chapel Hill NC 27514\r\n\r\nTo Register, click here!\r\n\r\nFor more information, please call 919-966-8586 or email mindfulness@med.unc.edu\r\n\r\nPlease visit our website for additional course information and like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The Program begins with an Orientation meeting in May that allows interested faculty members to meet with the groups to which they have been assigned on the basis of their expressed preferences. Groups meet regularly throughout the summer at times that suit them and have the freedom to structure their activities as they wish.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI see the Summer Writing Group program as one of the most valuable, pan-university programs that we offer. We are delighted to be working with additional research faculty for this year’s program and invite you to participate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Summer Writing Group Program Orientation Meeting will be held on Friday, May 4, 2018, 12:00PM-2:00PM (lunch included), Room 504 of Wilson Library. You can register here* by filling out a brief survey to collect writing group preferences. Deadline to register is Friday, April 27th, 2018. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor any inquiries about this program or other CFE research programming, please direct questions to Erin Malloy at erin_malloy@med.unc.edu.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*If the link does not work above, please copy and paste the following sign-up link into your web browser: https:\/\/unc.az1.qualtrics.com\/jfe\/form\/SV_3O8W594RSQ24bsN",

Following Dr. Mucha, each CAREER winner attending will briefly share from their experience with the CAREER program. For the last portion of the workshop, we will offer time to break into small group sessions, where mentors will work in more detail with the applicants to answer their questions about the process or their research ideas. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested, please email me, Denise Lindley at lindleyd@email.unc.edu to get more information. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDenise Lindley\r\nOffice of Research Development",

To qualify, you must have a BMI of 30 or above (formula below) and do not exercise for more than 3 hours per week. \r\n\r\n    You will perform a submaximal and maximal leg extension exercises of your thigh muscles with sensors taped to your muscles, and size and quality of your thigh muscles will be measured using ultrasonography while you are at rest, and during the strength assessments. For completing both visits associated with this study, you will receive $60 and free health information from the testing.  Please let me know if you have any questions and if you are interested in participating in our study.

The group will meet twice per week and each class will last one hour and 15 minutes. Free parking is provided and the studio is on the bus route.\r\n\r\nAs part of the research study, participants will also come to the UNC campus on four occasions to complete assessments (free parking provided). The first two visits will be prior to beginning the Tai Chi class, and the final two visits will be after the 8-week Tai Chi period. The assessments will involve filling out questionnaires, telling us about your medical health, performing a variety of cognitive tasks, as well as collecting measurements of brain activity using EEG.\r\n\r\nTake the questionnaire! We'll let you know if you're eligible and provide further information on how to get started.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit taichistudy.web.unc.edu or contact Dr. Aaron Piepmeier at atpiepme@med.unc.edu.

As we shared with you in a February communication, the federal tax rate changes are a part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017.\r\n\r\nThe law increased the standard deduction, removed personal exemptions, increased the child tax credit, limited or discontinued certain deductions and changed the tax rates and brackets.  Due to these changes along with others, the IRS is recommending that all employees perform a paycheck checkup by using the Withholding Calculator on www.irs.gov\/withholding. This website contains more information concerning the Withholding Calculator and Federal Tax Withholding Tables.\r\n\r\nThe Withholding Calculator can help employees estimate their 2018 annual income tax liability, and based on its recommendations, can help prevent too little or too much income tax from being withheld.  The withholding calculator compares the annual income tax estimate to the employee’s current income tax withholding and can help them decide if they need to change their withholding.  Employees using the calculator will find it helpful to have their completed 2017 tax return accessible and most recent paystub.  Employees are also encouraged to contact their tax professional should they have questions on how to accurately complete the information contained on the withholding calculator.\r\n\r\nEmployees can use the results from the Withholding Calculator to determine if they should complete a new Form W-4, Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate. Form W-4 can be submitted electronically via the ConnectCarolina Self-Service menu.\r\n\r\nIf you have problems accessing the ConnectCarolina Self-Service items, please contact the Help Desk. If after working with the Help Desk you are unable to update your W-4 please contact Payroll Services at payroll@unc.edu for assistance.\r\n\r\nWalter Miller\r\nDirector of Payroll Services",

The new page will be easier to use for those new to ConnectCarolina and for students’ family members who only occasionally log in to ConnectCarolina. \r\n\r\nWhat is the connectcarolina.unc.edu website?\r\n\r\nThis is the page that we typically refer to as the “landing page” for ConnectCarolina and it’s distinguished by the two green buttons to access ConnectCarolina as well as an announcements section and other useful links. It’s the first page that you see before logging into ConnectCarolina.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Changes\r\n\r\nWe‘ve simplified the page layout and made it is easier to navigate. The links work the same as they do now. Only the look is different.\r\nLooking for the InfoPorte link? It’s in ConnectCarolina under Enterprise Reporting on the left.\r\nFor Students\r\n\r\nThe first column on the updated webpage is for students and their proxy users. Like today, students will click the big green button to get to the ConnectCarolina Student Center, and once in ConnectCarolina, everything will work the same as it does now. \r\n\r\nParents or others can pay bills or see student info by clicking the blue buttons in the lower left.  (As always, students first need to give them access.)\r\n\r\nClick the first link under the green button, Useful Links for Students to go to a friendlier version of the page students currently use.\r\n\r\nFor Faculty, Staff, and Affiliates\r\n\r\nImportant links for Faculty, Staff and Affiliates are in the middle column.  We’ve added a few extra links to online and classroom training, online documentation and the ConnectCarolina User Info website.\r\n\r\nThe third column includes Useful Links, Security Information and the Announcements section. \r\n\r\nQuestions?\r\n\r\nSend an email to cc_communications@unc.edu if you have questions or concerns. There is no associated outage and it will not impact registration or other work in ConnectCarolina.",

This bilingual event serves to celebrate the work and dedication that students have devoted to the Latinx community. Students do not have to identify as Latinx to participate.\r\n\r\nProfessor Nilda Peragallo Montana, Dean of the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Nursing, will deliver the keynote. Following our tradition, all participating students will receive a unique Éxitos Latinx stole as a small token of appreciation for their commitment.\r\n\r\nFamilies and friends will have the opportunity to connect with the people who have guided the graduating students on their Carolina journey, take pictures with Rameses, and enjoy Latinx-inspired cuisine. We will also livestream the event on Facebook.\r\n\r\nRSVP required. Please register here.\r\n\r\nPlease contact Josmell Perez at josmell@unc.edu if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nThe Carolina Latinx Collaborative\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ",

Andrews Distinguished Professor of Pediatrics in the School of Medicine, and has held a variety of other senior administrative positions at Carolina.  \r\n\r\nThe Institute for the Environment is charged with supporting the University’s multi-disciplinary community of environmental researchers, enhancing collaboration, sharing knowledge, and developing solutions to critical environmental problems facing North Carolina and the world.  It works with partners across the University and externally to coordinate and deliver 21st century programs that provide students with experience and skills they can use to thrive in a growing global economy.  It takes environmental discoveries and knowledge and puts them into practice by engaging and serving communities here in North Carolina and around the globe.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in welcoming Mike Piehler to his new role at the Institute for the Environment and thanking Dave Peden for his capable stewardship as IE’s interim director. \r\n\r\n ",

    "content": "On behalf of Jessica Brinker, Interim Director, William &amp; Ida Friday Center for Continuing Education:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am pleased to share this year’s continuing education report which shows programs supporting Carolina’s mission of public service and instruction. In the 2016-2017 reporting year, UNC-Chapel Hill departments and outreach units engaged a record 448,736 individuals in North Carolina and around the world in continuing education activities. The 2016–17 Continuing Education Programs and Registrations report can be seen at:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/fridaycenter.unc.edu\/files\/2018\/03\/2016-2017-Continuing-Education-Programs-and-Registrations-Final-Report.pdf\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor the one-year period ending June 30, 2017, 28 units of the University reported information on 3,753 noncredit continuing education courses of various kinds, in which 448,736 individuals enrolled. The previous year’s figures were 3,496 courses and 395,500 registrants.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 2016-17, courses were offered in 59 counties in North Carolina, 26 states other than our own (including the District of Columbia), and 51 foreign countries.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCourses were conducted in a variety of formats. Online course offerings continued to be in demand. These courses comprised 51 percent of the registrant total, followed by classroom courses at 24 percent of the registrant total.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe breadth of continuing education programming and the diverse clientele it serves are illustrated by the programming highlights shown in the last part of the report, which some units chose to provide along with their data.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is clear from this report that we are helping individuals at the local, state, and international level achieve personal and professional educational goals through the continuing education opportunities offered by the University. Through the annual compilation of this report, the Friday Center is proud to play a role in supporting the University’s commitment to lifelong learning and outreach.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please don’t hesitate to contact me at Jessica_Brinker@unc.edu.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJessica Brinker\r\n\r\nInterim Director, William &amp; Ida Friday Center for Continuing Education\r\n\r\nDirector of Credit Programs\r\n\r\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\r\n\r\n100 Friday Center Drive, Campus Box 1020\r\n\r\nChapel Hill, NC 27599\r\n\r\nT: 919-962-2646\r\n\r\nfridaycenter.unc.edu\r\n\r\nmore.unc.edu\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

Effective immediately, Procurement Services will consist of four functional units: Purchasing Services, eProcurement and Materials Management, Accounts Payable and Travel Services, and Procurement Services Operations. \r\n\r\nJessica Hwang-Strickland will manage the new Procurement Services Operations unit, which will focus on P-Card operations, capital asset management, metrics and continuous improvement. As part of this merger of functions, several staff moves will take place: Beverly Braxton and Hua Shen will move to this unit from Purchasing Services and will continue to support P-Card operations.\r\n\r\nThe new eProcurement and Materials Management unit will be managed by Ammar Yameen, and will focus on logistics and eProcurement functions.  Logistics will now include the following:  surplus store, central receiving, mini storeroom and the dental stockroom.  Al Jeter, longtime manager of surplus store operations, has been promoted and will lead all logistics operations, including central receiving, surplus property and the general storeroom, with the exception of the dental stockroom, which will continue to be led by Kris Tilley. \r\n\r\nSystems and Operations will be renamed as Accounts Payable and Travel Services and will continue to be led by Janet Rupert.\r\n\r\nPurchasing Services will remain under the leadership of Bernard Law.\r\n\r\nDuring the next several weeks, we will update our website and staff listings to reflect these changes.  During this transition period, if you have any questions or concerns about the reorganization, please contact Travis Henderson at travishenderson@unc.edu.\r\n\r\n Note:  This memo was sent to Major Organizational Unit (MOU) Financial Leads, University Business Managers and the Research Administrative Support Group (RASG) Listserv.\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

The announcements of the prizes will be made at the first Faculty Council meeting of the fall term of 2018.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to help recognize and reward the work of Carolina’s most promising young faculty.",

To register, please visit: http:\/\/policies.unc.edu\/training.\r\n\r\nBeginning on March 29th, the current link to a limited list of University policies (https:\/\/policies.unc.edu\/all-policies) will redirect to https:\/\/unc.policystat.com\/.  If your School, Department or Unit currently links to any policies listed on, please be sure to update your links to those specific polices.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns about a specific policy, please reach out to the Responsible Unit or Issuing Officer.  If you have any questions about the transition, PolicyStat or general policy questions, please refer to our transition information page online, email our office at policy@unc.edu or give me a ring at the number below.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nTinu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAtinuke O.

To be eligible for this pilot study, you and your partner must meet the following criteria:\r\n\r\n-Living together more than 6 months\r\n-Age 21 or older\r\n-Identify as cisgender (biological\/birth sex aligns with gender identity)\r\n-Identify as female\r\n-Have a certain level of distress in your relationship, including stress related to living in a heteronormative society (this will be assessed on the phone screen)\r\n\r\nWhile we would hope for this program to be available to all couples, for the purpose of this initial pilot study we can only recruit a small sample of 12 couples.

This bilingual event serves to celebrate the work and dedication that students have devoted to the Latinx community. Students do not have to identify as Latinx to participate.\r\n\r\nProfessor Nilda Peragallo Montana, Dean of the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Nursing, will deliver the keynote. Following our tradition, all participating students will receive a unique Éxitos Latinx stole as a small token of appreciation for their commitment.\r\n\r\nFamilies and friends will have the opportunity to connect with the people who have guided the graduating students on their Carolina journey, take pictures with Rameses, and enjoy Latinx-inspired cuisine. We will also livestream the event on Facebook.\r\n\r\nRSVP required. Please register here.\r\n\r\nPlease contact Josmell Perez at josmell@unc.edu if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nThe Carolina Latinx Collaborative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ",

    "content": "Hello, my name is Eric Trexler.  I am a doctoral student in the Department of Exercise and Sport Science, and I am currently recruiting participants for a research study, entitled “Performance effects of citrulline malate and beetroot juice supplementation.”\r\n\r\nWe are looking for healthy, recreationally active men between the ages of 18-35. To qualify for this study, you must be a non-smoker who typically exercises at least two hours per week. In addition, you must not be using supplements or prescription drugs that may influence performance. The purpose of this study is to determine if acute supplementation with the commercially available dietary supplements citrulline malate and\/or beetroot juice influence leg strength or muscular endurance.\r\n\r\nAs a participant, you will be required to sign an informed consent document stating you understand all of the procedures and rights as a research subject, and to fill out questionnaires regarding your health, diet, and physical activity history. The study includes 4 lab visits over the course of 12-30 days.\r\n\r\nYour first visit will involve filling out some paperwork and becoming familiarized to the leg extension strength test. At the final three visits, you will consume either citrulline malate, beetroot juice, or a placebo, in random order. Strength testing will be repeated at each visit, two hours after supplement ingestion, to assess leg strength and endurance. During testing, we will noninvasively measure blood flow, muscle size, and oxygen consumption. We will also draw a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm before and after the exercise. All testing will take place in the Neuromuscular Research Laboratory and Applied Physiology Laboratory, which are both located in Fetzer Hall.\r\n\r\nIf you complete the study, you will receive up to $75 in compensation, along with free strength testing. If you are interested or have questions, please contact Eric Trexler by phone or email.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEric Trexler\r\n\r\ntrexlere@live.unc.edu\r\n\r\n919-962-2163\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis study (IRB #17-2666) was approved by the UNC Biomedical IRB on 3\/8\/2018",

In keeping with this goal, the University will implement a central pool for the payout of terminal leave effective July 1, 2018. This central terminal leave payout pool will fund any unused vacation and bonus leave that is eligible for payout upon an employee’s separation from the University. Composite benefits and severance pay are already paid from a separate central pool and will continue to operate with no changes.\r\n\r\n The central terminal leave payout pool will be funded by an assessment of 1.2% of all SHRA and EHRA Non-Faculty employees’ salary funding sources, for each pay period, using a new account code (516130). This rate was determined by reviewing past leave payouts over the past five fiscal years. The total payouts from this central pool will be reviewed annually and the rate will be increased or decreased to adjust for higher or lower than expected payouts.\r\n\r\nThe existing central composite benefits and severance pay rates will remain unchanged for fiscal year 2018-19 and will also continue to be reviewed annually. A summary of the applicable rates is listed below.\r\n\r\nAny terminal leave payouts that are due to employees that separate from the University July 1, 2018 or later will be paid from the central pool and departments will no longer be responsible for those charges. Although this new Terminal Leave Payout assessment may have an impact on how schools and departments plan and budget, we anticipate that the change will provide for greater financial predictability as departments will pay for terminal leave payouts incrementally in advance rather than at the time of employee separation which may not always be anticipated.\r\n\r\nComposite Benefits Fund\r\n\r\nExpense Account Code: 516120\r\nSalary Base: EHRA and SHRA Salaries paid from Non-State Funds\r\nRate: 0.50% (Unchanged from prior FY)\r\n\r\nSeverance Pay Pool\r\n\r\nExpense Account Code: 512510\r\nSalary Base: SHRA Salaries paid from Non-State Funds\r\nRate: 1.00% (Unchanged from prior FY)\r\n\r\nTerminal Leave Payout Pool\r\n\r\nExpense Account Code: 516130\r\nSalary Base: EHRA Non-Faculty and SHRA paid from All Funds\r\nRate: 1.20% (New)",
